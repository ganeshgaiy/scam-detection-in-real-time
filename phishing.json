        "selftext": "One of the most common questions posted here is what to do if you've clicked on a phishing link. This short guide is intended to help with these questions and what to do if you've clicked on a phishing link.\n\n**DO NOT ENTER ANY CREDENTIALS OR LOGIN DETAILS FOR ANYTHING IF YOU'VE CLICKED ON A MALICIOUS LINK.**\n\n\n1. Links are generally not malicious on their own. While clicking on any unknown links can be dangerous it is difficult to design a phish that works just by clicking the link. Most links take you to a (usually fake) page that will ask for certain credentials. As long as you closed the page after you clicked the link you're *probably* fine, but it's still a good idea to change your password for whatever service the phishing link was trying to access (such as amazon).\n\n2. If you clicked a link that downloaded a file, delete the file. Generally these files aren't harmful unless opened after downloading.\n\n3. If you've clicked a phishing link and have provided credentials to a service, change the password for that service. Say you've been tricked into giving someone your Amazon credentials. Go to Amazon.com directly and change your password. Also, check the \"third-party account access\" section of your commonly used websites. Often phishing links and malicious services will try to authorize themselves to your account rather than outright stealing your credentials.\n\n4. When logging into websites with sensitive information such as a bank it's best to bookmark the site and visit the site directly each time from that bookmark. That way you know that the website you're using is the real one.\n\n5. **ENABLE 2FA (TWO FACTOR AUTHENTICATION)** This is perhaps the best thing you can do to protect your sensitive accounts. All websites that deal with sensitive information will allow you to use either your phone number or an authentication app (I like Authy) to generate one-time login codes to further secure your account. Unless someone gets your credentials and your 2FA device (your phone) they won't be able to access your account.\n\n6. **Please** use a password manager of some sort. This will allow you to use strong and unique passwords for each site you use. If one of your accounts is hacked or phished all of your other accounts will be safe with unique passwords (unless your email was hacked/phished).\n7. Ensure you have a backup email and/or phone number connected to your primary email account so that you can recover access if you're locked out. Additionally, make sure your recovery methods are as secure as your primary email login.",

The MINIMUM recovery procedure :\n\n1. Instantly disconnect from the Internet \n2. Restart router\n3. Reboot laptop, reset VPN and reconnect to the Internet\n4. Change Office365 password\n5. Mark the email (and future look alikes) as Spam\n6. Update Norton tools and scan/clean malware",

        "selftext": "Sharing this here in the hopes that someone stumbles across this post when googling to find out if they\u2019re caught in a scam.\n\nBank fraud scams are getting more and more elaborate. Today I received a phone call from a Citibank number. The caller told me someone opened a bank account in my name and were calling me to verify it. Someone has actually tried to open a credit card in my name before so I wasn\u2019t surprised it was happening again. I said no and please close the account. They told me they were canceling the account but two transactions were pending from Zelle and I needed to call Zelle and cancel the charges. They gave me a second number to call. I was panicked at this point and called it. But once I was on the phone again I realized it was a scam when they asked me to add a contact to my Zelle account and add a routing number (presumably to ask me to send money to it to \u201ccancel\u201d the charges). I started to push them a little bit and it became more clear this was a scam operation when I got them off script. It had initially been convincing because Citibank was in the caller ID, they gave me \u201ctransaction numbers,\u201d and someone has actually tried to open an account in my name before. I did some Googling and found that it was a real former Citibank number that scammers now spoof. \n\nI am so glad I caught this at the last moment. Sharing here in the hopes no one else falls for it.",

The text literally says \"We'll NEVER call or text for this code.\" I kept repeating this to them and told them I wasn't going to give it to them. The guy then started yelling that I need to give him the code otherwise I would be charged for the fraud. I told him I wouldn't give it to him and he got mad then hung up. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI then locked my card and immediately called Citi and they said it wasn't them and they sent me a new card.",

I also said I'd give my mom $10k cuz she's lately been worried about money (or luck thereof) and I'd love for her twilight years to be spent worry-free. She was recently diagnosed with Parkinsons and every time something or someone causes her stress; it makes it worse. I just love her so much and if anyone in this world deserves to be care and worry free, it's her. And I don't say that simply because she's my mom; she truly is a wonderful and giving person. \n\nI almost bought this one as he didn't ask for any personal financial information or my social security number. I'm sure that in itself was a ruse to make it look less risky. I don't know exactly how this scam works but from reading the posts about it from other folks, it sounds like when you send that email to \"FedEx\", that's when the shit hits the fan. It's got to be when they tell a person they need them to send a processing fee to send the check to you. I had asked the guy what form of payment he sends and he got so defensive. It sucks that it's a scam. I was hoping it was just the \"knight in shining armor\" finally coming to save me from being homeless. Too good to be true! Of course!",

Hence your antivirus is unable to detect its presence.\nI made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of the screen, and the right half shows the video you were watching at the time.\n\nWith one mouse click, I can send this video to all your emails and contacts on your social networks.\nI can also make public all your e-mail correspondence and chat history on the messengers that you use.\n\nIf you don't want this to happen, transfer $1450 in Bitcoin equivalent to my Bitcoin address (if you do not know how to do this, just search \"buy bitcoin\" on Google).\n\nMy Bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: 1GnGGkm4kRjhU71mZSUCEkkQFNbCpGAneG\n\nAfter confirming your payment, I will delete the video immediately, and that's it. You will never hear from me again.\nI will give you 50 hours (more than 2 days) to pay. I will get a notice, when you open this email, and the timer will start.\nFiling a complaint somewhere does not make sense because this email cannot be tracked like my Bitcoin address.\n\nI never make any mistakes.\nIf I find that you have shared this message with someone else, the video will be immediately distributed.",

I had just accepted to start a new role at a new company. A day or 2 after accepting this offer I received a call from an unknown number(usually unknown numbers are blocked) so I picked up with the text call feature on my phone. \n\nThey were offering me a role within the same company with a similar role but higher pay. This company's name is Dexian and they seem to be a recruiting firm. The recruiter had a very thick accent but also sounded very professional. At first I was hesitant with the whole thing but i decided to go with it and see what happens. They emailed me the job description and other details regarding this position. They needed me to send my resume so i replied back with it. Boom radio silence since then I haven't heard anything. So I'm thinking this is where my information was obtained for them to fill in the blanks to their what I'm guessing is a template to email their victims. \n\nI haven't gotten around to it but I was thinking of doing some chain analysis on the address to see if i can find any information. I doubt I'll find much but if anyone has anyone has an stories they want to share or any information I'd like to hear what you guys think.\n\nIt's pretty disgusting what these people do. I wanted to post this for anyone who may have received anything similar and are looking for information. Don't fall for this stuff yall.",

Went to my bank website, blocked my card from being used, and even change my bank password and will be calling the bank tomorrow to dispute the charge. Is there anything else I should do?

        "selftext": "Hi there I received this email a few months ago\n\nI have read about this scam but this comes with a twist, There have been continuation mails, first it came witha couple of screenof a dude apparently watching porn, I made the mistake of opening them (which could have in that moment really infected my computer  \n\n\nThe issue is that after that there have been more and more personalized  subjects text in the mail because the hacker by now must have figured out that I stopped opening his mails after opening the pics\n\nI received a last email of him a couple of days ago that titled \"the countdown has begun\", again I didnt oppened but deleted it instead ( honestly I am really frightened of what can I find in there).\n\nI have scanned the computer with several virus defenders with no success, apparently all the systems are ok\n\nWhat frigthens me is that the exact same computer, generally I dont use it for watch porn (I watch on my phone), but the last email arrived (titled \"the countdown has begun\") after a few days I used it to indeed watch porn\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo indeed I suspect that the person in question has some quind of access to the computer screen or camera, what I see is that the my mail where I have been receiving these mails ( in which I have double factor autentication ) has at least 15 to 20 failed attempted logins every day.\n\nWhat I have done for now is to unlink the mail from the computer administrator profile and just created a new fresdh one just in case (Did this help?)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know this has been discussed in the past, but I beleive some kind of real hacker is using this scam to truly attack on me, Can someone really really help me?\n\n  \n..\n\n*Hi there!*\n\n*I regret to inform you about some sad news for you.*  \n*Approximately a month or two ago I have succeeded to gain a total access to all your devices utilized for browsing internet.*  \n*Moving forward, I have started observing your internet activities on continuous basis.*\n\n*Go ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for your reference:*  \n*Initially I bought an exclusive access from hackers to a long list of email accounts (in today\u2019s world, that is really a common thing, which can arranged via internet).*  \n*Evidently, it wasn\u2019t hard for me to proceed with logging in your email account (xxx).*\n\n*Within the same week, I moved on with installing a Trojan virus in Operating Systems for all devices that you use to login to email.*  \n*Frankly speaking, it wasn\u2019t a challenging task for me at all (since you were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails before).*  \n*Yeah, geniuses are among us.*\n\n*Because of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone and others).*  \n*As result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web browsing history and other types of data to my servers.*  \n*Moreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you regularly use, including emails, including chat history, messengers, contacts list etc.*  \n*My unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control by a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of antiviruses.*\n\n*Hence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always remained undetected until this very letter\u2026*\n\n*During the process of compilation of all the materials associated with you,*  \n*I also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of websites hosting nasty adult content.*  \n*Turns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.*  \n*As a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to record certain nasty solo action with you in main role,*  \n*and later produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming scenes.*\n\n*If until now you don\u2019t believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to make all those videos with everyone you know,*  \n*including your friends, colleagues, relatives and others.*  \n*Moreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone to see.*  \n*I sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly watched videos,*  \n*(you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause a huge adversity for you.*\n\n*There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to do:*  \n*You make a transaction of $1490 USD to my account (an equivalent in bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of funds transfer),*  \n*hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately get rid of all those lustful videos without delay.*  \n*After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening beforehand.*  \n*Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to worry about,*  \n*because I keep my word at all times.*\n\n*That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced price,*  \n*taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were under close monitoring during a long time frame.*  \n*If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions with bitcoins \u2013 everything is available online.*\n\n*Below is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference: 1GS1SRz3QBC1NUeuhu8EWkx37qQXanUxGG*\n\n*All you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is opened (in other words 2 days).*\n\n*The following list includes things you should remember and avoid doing:*  \n*> There\u2019s no point to try replying my email (since this email and return address were created inside your inbox).*  \n*> There\u2019s no point in calling police or any other types of security services either. Furthermore, don\u2019t you dare sharing this info with any of your friends.*  \n*If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously monitor them) \u2013*  \n*your nasty clip will be shared with public straight away.*  \n*> There\u2019s no point in looking for me too \u2013 it won\u2019t result in any success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and untraceable.*  \n*> There\u2019s no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to throw them away. That won\u2019t solve the issue,*  \n*since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on remote servers.*\n\n*Things that may be concerning you:*  \n*> That funds transfer won\u2019t be delivered to me.*  \n*Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds transfer is finished,*  \n*I will know for sure, since I interminably track down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes remotely, just as TeamViewer).*  \n*> That your videos will be distributed, even though you have completed money transfer to my wallet.*  \n*Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I would do make it happen way earlier!*\n\n*We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!*\n\n*In conclusion, I\u2019d like to recommend one more thing\u2026 after this you need to make certain you don\u2019t get involved in similar kind of unpleasant events anymore!*  \n*My recommendation \u2013 ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones on a regular basis.*  \n\n\n&#x200B;",

He's playing on your fears. The level of control that claims to have is inconsistent of how he's asking you to pay. Specifically, he's telling you that he has complete control of all your systems and knows everything you do, and that he's going to give you a break and let you pay him without destroying your stuff.\n\nHe's giving you no reason to believe that he has such control. I don't think he can. I think he's trying to trick you into thinking that he has it.\n\nWhat's the worst case scenario? That he publishes pictures of you masturbating? Everyone masturbates. So is what he's threatening worth $1,500 bucks? I wouldn't pay him.\n\nCalculating risk works like this: you measure the impact that an event might have on you, and the likelihood.\n\nImpact: how much would what he threatens to do impact your life? Answer very much, a lot, some, a little, very little\n\nLikelihood: what's the likelihood that he will carry out his threat? Answer very much, a lot, some, a little, very little\n\nI must point this out, it didn't occur to you. He claimed that he bought your user access for your email online. That's a real thing people do that. However you reported that you saw failed logins to your email account. That is inconsistent with his claim. It is possible that someone else was trying to break into your user account. That happens all the time too. However, the timing is pretty coincidental.\n\nFor myself, I would call the impact \"some\" and the likelihood very low. That results in a manageable risk. I'd tell him to fuck off.",

        "selftext": "Context: I happened to spot this email in my spam folder because I saw it was from \"me\". I know usually emails are only maid to look like it came from yourself, but this didn't show an email, it said \"me\" and hovering over it it had my email.  \n\n\nI've changed all the important password I can think of, tried the free Norton trial on my phone (nothing). What else do I do? Is there any legitimacy?  \n\n\nHere's the email:  \n Hello, my perverted friend,  \n\n\nUnfortunately, the fact that our paths have crossed doesn't mean anything good for you.  \nI have some good news and bad news.  \nI'll start with the bad news.  \n\n\nWhile you were surfing porn sites, I managed to install a spyware using your browser.  \nIt has gained access to your webcam, your browser history, and all your devices, not just your computer.  \n\n\nThis alone wouldn't be a problem if only I wasn't particularly interested in your love of the very controversial genre of pornography.  \nYou know what I mean. I saved a backup copy of your webcam and screen recordings as you enjoy jerking off to these videos.  \nThe video on the left shows a recording of your screen with the clip, while the one on the right shows you in real time.  \n\n\nThere is no need to feel sorry for yourself or blame me for the situation - the fault here is yours alone because if you gaze into a dark abyss for too long,  \nthis darkness eventually will come knocking at your door.  \nYou should even be grateful to fate that I'm the only one who discovered your unhealthy obsession and not your friends, family and colleagues.  \n\n\nAnd this is where I get to the essence of my message - I can easily organize this. Everyone you know, love and cherish,  \neveryone you've spent years building your reputation as a respectable and honorable person in front of,  \nwill get a copy of the video of you self-pleasing yourself while watching these controversial videos.  \n\n\nAll of your email and messengers contacts will get these videos at the same time.  \nYou will have nothing left but to move to another city, and perhaps even another country, to get rid of the sick guy trail that will be running behind you.  \nHowever, this also might not help. As they say, the Internet remembers everything.  \nThere's a good chance you will have to deal with the consequences for the rest of your life, despite your efforts to clear your name.  \n\n\nNow, as I promised, the good news.  \nI have a win-win solution for both you and me.  \nYou regain your old free life and I make a small profit.  \n\n\nYou should transfer $1250 to my Bitcoin wallet: 1FECxHyNFvYjj7FVQtmD1GrMxoLEBFHDCV  \n\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with cryptocurrency, it's simple.  \nType \"crypto exchange\" into the search engine and choose the option that suits you.  \nYou can think of me as a kind of your life coach because if I didn't show up in your life,  \nyou would continue to lead the same destructive lifestyle as before.  \nSo I kind of did you a favor, and favors are never free.  \n\n\nI must warn you not to do something stupid that you might do due to your lack of experience, such as:  \n& Contacting law enforcement.  \n\u00a0I'm untraceable anyway, because cryptocurrencies are anonymous and I have access to all your devices,  \n\u00a0so as soon as I notice you trying to do something like this, the compromising clips will be made public.  \n& Negotiating with me by responding to this letter. My demands are ultimatums.  \n\u00a0I generated this letter using your own email client, therefore it is impossible to contact me!  \n& Resetting, reinstalling your system or destroying your devices won't help you.  \n\u00a0I repeat: I have access to them and if I notice such activity, hasta la vista, baby.  \n\n\nI wish you all the best and especially get rid of your \"interesting\" habits.  \nThen you will not only no longer encounter people like me, but you will also be able to reach a new quality level in your self-development.  \n\n\nBye!  \n\n\nP.S. A little friendly advice: from now on, take what you do online more seriously. ",

Aufgrund der Geheimhaltung dieser Transaktion verst\u00f6\u00dft es gegen unsere Bankethik, mich direkt an dieser Transaktion zu beteiligen. Aus diesem Grund muss ich eine andere E-Mail-Adresse verwenden,um Sie zu erreichen, damit wir diese Transaktion durchf\u00fchren k\u00f6nnen. Als Insider in der Bank muss ich von au\u00dfen mit Ihnen zusammenarbeiten, um Ihnen Orientierung zu geben. Ich bin bereit, dieses Gesch\u00e4ft mit Ihnen abzuschlie\u00dfen, unter der Bedingung, dass Sie mich nicht verraten, wenn Sie diesen Fonds haben. Ich kontaktiere Sie, um mich als Beg\u00fcnstigter des von unserem verstorbenen ausl\u00e4ndischen Kunden bei der UBS Investment Bank, London hinterlassenen Geldes vorzustellen, damit meine Bank das Geld genehmigen und an Sie \u00fcberweisen kann. Lassen Sie mich Ihnen alles gut erkl\u00e4ren, damit Sie es richtig verstehen. Als leitender Angestellter der UBS Investment Bank, London, entdeckte ich ein Konto eines unserer j\u00fcngsten Kunden, eines arabischen Gesch\u00e4ftsmanns, Herrn Frederick Khan, eines Milliard\u00e4rs, der bei einem t\u00f6dlichen Autounfall im Januar 2007 ums Leben kam Bisher kennt keiner sein Bankkonto bei der UBS Investment Bank,London Plc und meine weiteren Untersuchungen haben ergeben, dass auch seine nahen Verwandten bei der Trag\u00f6die ums Leben kamen.Ich brauche nur Ihr Vertrauen und Ihre Zusammenarbeit.

        "selftext": "I have been doing some web development on my local computer, and noticed on Firefox's dev tools a request to some JavaScript file on Amazon S3. I beautified the code and a quick glance revealed stuff totally unrelated to downloading YouTube videos; attempts at modifying Facebook, Amazon, Google search results, etc. on the fly. I immediately started disabling Firefox extensions one by one until the phishing request disappeared.\n\nThe culprit was a Firefox add-on, [\"Youtube Video Downloader Ultimate 1.2\"](https://imgur.com/cpn3mo5), which I completely forgot I had even installed. I have checked that at least Facebook (thankfully) disables cross-origin requests, so the script does not even load. I suspect Amazon et al have the same kind of protection. At any rate, this was definitely a stressful few minutes for me. I removed the add-on and reset most of my passwords.\n\nMake sure to check for this add-on on your Firefox installation. I have been feeling terribly stupid.",

You see, usually the unusual activity alert comes from \"`account-xxxxxxxxx-noreply@accountxxxxxx.microsoft.com`\" but the sender to this mail is \"`no-reply@microsoft.com`\" Then I checked the links in the mail. They are all MailTo links, clicking on them opens a new mail, addressed to `unusual.activity@recognized-sec.com`. A quick google search told me that this site \"recognized-sec.com\" is not safe, so I didn't open it. If I have to guess, it must be trying to mimic \"sec.gov\" or \"sec.com\". Then I logged into my mail account, and checked the recent activities. I did see a bunch of failed login attempts (Probably by using an old password from some hacked accounts DB), but no successful login from Russia.\n\nSo I am more inclined to believe that its a fraudulent email, trying to phish/bait me. But how a MailTo link will do it? If I clicked on the link, it will simply open a new email in my email client. So what's going on here, I'm confused.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ztsd9qtakcja1.jpg?width=1743&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9adf7f1aa151b128ad30c85a61e617863cb023b9",

I didn't click anything in the email, mind you, just copied the listed tracking number. \n\nA few days later, I got an email for a digital music download for some related music. I'm assuming it was this person again.\n\nAm I missing something here on whether or not this could be some sort of scam? I checked all my cc and bank accounts and there's nothing fishy going on, and I have 2FA on everything. I'm just confused what's going on...",

I saw [this article](https://deadline.com/2024/09/sabrina-carpenter-short-n-sweet-1236076862/) mentioning that Travis Scott lost out to #1 album of the week ending in Aug 31 by 1k units to Sabrina Carpenter, which coincides with when you and everyone else resurrected this thread. My best guess is somehow the \"confirmed\" orders count on the charts even if they don't ever ship?",

        "selftext": "I fell for my first ever scam text, hoping to tell my tail of woe and get insight on the potential consequences of my actions. I had a USPS delivery scheduled for today and around the time I was supposed to get the package, I got the above text. Now I should have been paying more attention, but in my moment of weakness I thought it was legit and responded 1. I could have sworn this was something that I had to do in the past. I go to the webpage on my iPhone in safari, I enter my name, address, phone number, and email. I click next and I pause. It said it wanted a credit card from me. I thought that was weird so I relooked at the email and saw the link was funky and realized my mistake. I also saw that they tracking number they had was not the same one as my order. I exited out of the webpage, cleared my safari web data history, and restarted my iPhone.\n\nThey didn\u2019t get a credit card information from me, nor a username and login. I was wondering if I should be doing anything else to prevent further damage. This was all done from my iPhone, so I am hoping that mitigates the potential damage.",

A few days ago, I got this text very early in the morning, and groggily replied 1 because I was eagerly awaiting my package. I send the 1, and was confused that I didn\u2019t get a reply. So, I clicked the link, and started typing in the address. When it asked for my credit card number, I got annoyed (was groggy in bed, didn\u2019t have wallet with me) and closed my browser, went back to sleep. About five or six hours later, I remembered the occurrence and panicked, realizing how much of a scam it could have been. When i saw that the text was from an iCloud account, I was filled with dread. I just rationalized that, since I was too lazy to give away my credit card number, everything would be fine. \n\nThen, today I was thinking about it again after seeing a Reddit post about a different phishing scam, and found your post.",

I called Mastercard anyway because BoA said they had no control of that feature and only Mastercard could stop it.

So they can\u2019t update merchants. \n\nAt this point I think it\u2019s definitely an inside job and I\u2019m going to switch banks. I don\u2019t like how unhelpful BoA was with the whole thing.

However, that doesn't make sense to me at all.\n\nThe only link present in this email is the Chase link, which does in fact go directly to Chase's website. The phone number is the same phone number available on Chase's website. The email is signed by Chase's mail server, and the email address matches every other email I've received from Chase in the past. The CS rep told me this isn't a real email address, but literally every statement or correspondence I have received from Chase has been from the same no-reply@alertsp.chase.com.\n\nWhat's the deal? Is this just a weird spam message? If so how did they know my card is locked? What's the goal here?\n\nNow I am trying to dig around and see if there is a recurring charge I forgot to remove from this card...",

It asked for my debit card number and pin before I even hear the intro menu.\n\nI entered that and got connected to a rep after a while. She said that it might be a phishing email and suggested not to click any link. And asked me to forward it to [phishing@chase.com](mailto:phishing@chase.com) .  But then I said, I called the number from the email itself. She asked me the phone number and said that \"This is not a chase number\". \n\nSince as per this lady, this is not a chase number we believed that a scammer might be recording a call, or may have recorded my card details at the start and routed the call to the Chase later.\n\n  \nSo I hung up and called a number from Chase mobile app 1800-935-9935. This time too it asked for card details, but I kept pressing 0 so it connected me to a rep. I told the situation and she immediately asked if I changed my phone carrier recently? I had switched from ATT to Tmob. She said, that's the reason the number was removed from Zelle. Since she asked it upfront without me telling her that I had changed the carrier, this was a bit assuring that she knows what she's talking about.  \nWe also talked about the first call that I had. She confirmed that the first lady was indeed a chase agent. But she couldn't confirm the phone number (1-877-242-7372) is a Chase number. So I asked her to block my debit card and send a new one with new number/pin/cvv etc.\n\n  \nAnother comment here says \"*...so I did a Google search and it is a legitimate Chase number referenced in formal documentation...*\". I did the same, and I see this phone number in some chase document. So I think it is a safe phone number(?), but please don't quote me on it. It is always safer to call Chase form their app instead.",

Sender is [rujia82416@126.com](mailto:rujia82416@126.com). The message reads\n\nU.S.P.S - The package has arrived at the warehouse and cannot be delivered due to incomplete address information.Confirm your address at the link.\n\nhttps://eghtus.cc\n\n(Copy the link to your Safari browser and open it)\n\nI slipped up this time and they finally got me I think. I gave them my mail info and clicked the link which lead to nowhere, a blank phf type page, not sure. So I changed my amazon password, but then I realized this might not even be an Amazon related thing, so I have to change all my passwords now. Is this type of text message phishing?",

This looks like phishing, so I called Synchrony Bank, and they assured me the email is NOT from them, but someone impersonating them.

They assured me they were not, but I don't know how else to explain this! Beware.",

Is it possible for him to have my other passwords which I don't use for such sites? And I do not have only 8 friends on FB, but I did still change my password from the one he has just in case. And I do not own a webcam, my computer is a desktop and I have a tv as a monitor. What should I do?",

This is necessary in order to unlock the trillions of dollars in funding by way of massive public demand. The Global Campaign's Platform's goal is to invite 'millions of members to unite to put pressure on leaders, politicians and corporations to act for the climate. The corporations with the best advertising executives and largest budgets will be the winners. And 'green- washing will become an unprecedented method of advertising as will the art of storytelling. But, no one ever said a story has to be true... Our success hinges on building an active community around our core values... Finally, this behavioural science platform lends itself to the continued development of critical thinking...

Perhaps the macro didn't identify me as a target and redirected me away, or perhaps it was logging access to certain ids to collect a list of potential targets?\n\nIf anybody knows how to report the file from the id I gave above, it would be very appreciated.",

Was really freaked out because I know coin transfers immediately and you can't get it back and I felt insecure and not so knowledgeable about the crypto accounts I had opened. Called the number in the email (888)- 397-5703 and the guy claimed to tell me how to cancel the transaction. (In hindsight it's clear he didn't ask the right identifying information a customer service rep would normally ask and stumbled a little over the info I was giving him about the charge, but they got me early in the morning (I bet intentionally?) and $6k was a lot so I wasn't thinking clearly.\n\nFinally caught on that it was a horrible scam when they directed me to the ultraviewer website to \"fill out a cancelation form\". I assume they'd have me download remote access software and then steal all my logins? Pains me to say this (because I'm Indian) but it was an Indian guy on the phone. He sounded really compassionate and worried for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe email \"FROM\" address was [receipts@messaging.squareup.com](mailto:receipts@messaging.squareup.com) so pretty convincing. I checked with Square and that is not the email address they use to send emails.

The scam started with the excuse that this person wanted to send my mother a ring and a necklace but she had to pay for part of the present. The lies kept on going and the story kept on changing. Then he started saying he got sick and needed money for the operation, then for the hospital, a lawyer\u2026 god knows what. My mother ended up losing around 150K Euros to this scam. She tried to cut the communication but since she didn\u2019t change her telephone number despite me insisting on it, they kept on contacting her. \nAfter finding this out, she moved cities but I recently discovered she kept on talking with this person and sending money. \nFurthermore, despite my warnings she opened new Instagram accounts where more scammers made profit of her ignorance and nativity. To the date I have found three different main profiles and conversations with up to 5 different people who scammed her\u2026\nShe was contacted by a guy who said to be a US military person who needed cash to go visit her and a guy with a terminally ill daughter who needed her help. \nTo the date she\u2019s lost 230K\u20ac\nThis December I went to visit her and found out about all of the above plus over 12 loans she got to keep on sending money\u2026 I have even contacted a lawyer to try and save her from the debt\u2026after 10very hard days together, I thought this was over, that she understood the wrongs she did. Unfortunately the day after I left, she did again. She sent money to the guy with the sick daughter\u2026 via Bitcoins. \nI am currently desperate, not really knowing what to do. We\u2019ve been to the police station several times to leave a report. They said they would investigate but I do not have much hope left. \nRight now I cannot have my mum live with me because I live in a different country and even though she\u2019s open for therapy, the first appointment would be by the end of February. \nI would much appreciate anyone\u2019s opinion if you guys have been through something similar or have any clue in how I could deal with this. \nSorry for my bad grammar\u2026\n\n[TLDR] my mother was a victim of three different people phishing other people ended up almost in poverty. I fear an addiction and have no clue how to deal with this",

I think the problem with that is that you would become responsible for her debt. \n\nYou need to get your mother off of social media. She is on the radar as a known victim who is still paying out. If you can't get through to her that everyone contacting her is a scammer and that she's the only one that can stop it, you need to make a difficult decision about how involved you're going to continue being, because she's going to lead them to you, and even if you spot every phishing message you get, that doesn't stop them. You'll be on the radar as a potential victim.\n\nMaybe you can have her psychologically evaluated, but I don't know what's involved in that, especially if she's not willing. You don't get to have the butterfly net people kidnap her. Assemble documentation and get a lawyer, at least to protect you from her. If she has any way to create debt in your identity, that needs to get closed off. This happens in the US all the time with parents and guardians after the child is grown and moved out, the parent has all the info to create lines of credit.",

Additionally, this came about 1 hour after I got a legit Apple text saying that my \"parcel may arrive later than expected\" (a phone cover).\n\nI don't think this is the standard spam, I think this is someone involved in the shipping process reading names and taking phone numbers which are visible on packaging and then mass sending links. So, very directed phishing. Not suggesting it is someone at UPS, but anyone who handles, or even sees, the parcel.\n\nI have exactly zero proof, but the coincidence is just way too close - seeing as I've never once received a spam text with my name attached.\n\nEDIT: AHA! New wrinkle... I just tracked the delayed shipment (phone cover). Whereas the items I received today all came from the same location via UPS (within a few hours of my house) - the delayed phone cover is being shipped from Indianapolis via FedEx.\n\nThe text message I received telling me to fill in some shady Typeform? It had an Indianapolis area code.\n\nThis is suspect as fuck - though I don't really know what my next steps are.",

However, I can do it in a few clicks.\n \nEvery number in your contact Iist will suddenly receive these vid\u0435\u043es \u2013 on WhatsApp, on Telegram, on Instagram, on Facebook, on email \u2013 everywhere. It is going to be a tsunami that will sweep away everything in its path, and first of all, your f\u043erm\u0435r life.\n\nDon\u2019t think of yourself as an innocent victim. No one knows where your \u0440\u0435rv\u0435rsi\u043en might lead in the future, so consider this a kind of deserved \u0440unishm\u0435nt to stop you.\n \nI\u2019m some kind of God who sees everything. However, don\u2019t panic. As we know, God is merciful and forgiving,  and so do I. But my m\u0435r\u0441y is not free.\n \nTransfer 1300 USD to my Litecoin (LTC) wallet: ltc1qm6p7paz0k76733s6het3lgu8utxgyzxam6mmt4\n \nOnce I receive confirmation of the transaction, I will \u0440\u0435rmanently delete all videos compromising you, uninst\u0430ll Pegasus from all of your devices, and disappear from your life. You can be sure \u2013 my benefit is only money. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t be writing to you, but destroy your life without a word in a second.",

But that would be quite a sophisticated attack and is unlikely.\n\n\\-----\n\nWhat you can do IRL is just be vigilant; make sure to scrutinize any weird activity on your accounts and report it approrpiately. If all you did was give your address and credit card there shouldn't be too much people can do once you've changed your credit card info.  \n\n\nWhat you can do regarding tech, though unikely to be necessary, is running some anti-malware or possibly saving important information then resetting your devices. Probably even less reason to do this if you're on the apple.  \n\n\nHope that helps.",

        "selftext": "I was getting lots of phishing email to my inbox that bypassed my Spam filter. It was driving me crazy. And it got even worse after I reported one to [spam.org](https://spam.org). They started doubling down (2-3x) on that email address (thankfully not my main one), from 50 to about 120+ every day.\n\nPhishers (e.g., [printdus.com](https://printdus.com)) send from 'spoofed' (well-formed) fake email addresses. Even though the subject lines were clearly SPAM (misspellings, letters replaced by numbers, lots of icons, odd spacing, etc.), these landed in my inbox.\n\nI've been to all the videos from the pundits saying don't bother with 'block sender'--because they will just change it (mostly True) and rules won't work (that says Maybe).\n\nLarge email providers (gmail, outlook, etc.) check to see if sender domains are real as part of a Spam check. For example, [\"geeksquad@emailinfo.geeksquad.com](mailto:\"geeksquad@emailinfo.geeksquad.com)\" fails because \"[emailinfo.geeksquad.com](https://emailinfo.geeksquad.com)\" is a fake domain name. The goal is to get you to click the link, not reply, so they don't use real email addresses that can lead back to them. It looks good to the user (even though it's an ad for toe fungus), but the authorization checks say it's *possibly* Spam.\n\nWhy they get past Spam filters is that it might only \"soft\" fail. Soft fails are when a DNS (domain name server) times out or the Domain Keys Identified Mail (dkim) or Sender Policy Framework (spf) isn't provided. If any of them outright fail, it ends up in Junk folder, but soft fails (in my experience) sometimes get by.\n\nThe rule I use checks for the following \"words\" in every received **email header**: \"DNS Timeout\", \"dkim=none\" or \"spf=none\" and send them to my Junk folder. So far, that's fixed it.\n\nAnd if you want to stop wading through your Junk folder for non-phishing emails, create a second rule to *permanently delete* emails by adding these two phrases: \"dkim=fail\", \"compauth=fail\". It has to run manually, but when I do, all that is left in Junk is garden variety Spam, a few Nigerians offering me large sums of money and emails that were mistakenly classified as spam.\n\nAnd if you are curious: dkim is Domain Keys Identified Mail \\[check for forged senders\\]. spf is Sender Policy Framework \\[10 DNS fails\\]. CompuAuth is Composite Authorization \\[spoof check\\]. No legitimate sender will fail any of these checks. Even Spam passes. This only gets rid of (most) phishers.",

Sorry if I accidently broke them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI got an email titled \"Confirmation Receipt #9486717\" from AHS-Warranty ([xxxxx@gmail.com](mailto:xxxxx@gmail.com)). The graphics looked good and AHS (American Home Shield) is an actual company when I looked online. Very weird though because I never bought anything from them or heard of them. The email had a couple links, including an Unsubscribe link. It also had a phone number. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe phone number didn't match anything I could find online associated with AHS. And the email being a gmail account also looked really sketch to me. Rather than calling the phone number from the email, I called AHS's number instead (found online). I gave them my full name and phone number and they said that they couldn't find any account with my info, or any receipt with the receipt number I had. They also asked for my email to check if they sent anything, but I didn't give it to them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the first phishing email I've ever gotten that was halfway convincing, and it kind of spooked me because it was from my personal gmail account (which I don't share).",

There's different ways how people can harvest your info. Try to create a separate email that's solely for your social media and not tied to your bank acct. \n\nIf you ever receive an email from an email address you don't know, with an unknown domain ( in this case, *unifile.net* ), aside from open searching the company, you can try different sites to verify the legitimacy of the site.

        "selftext": "He got a phone call last night claiming to by someone on the \u201cHalifax Fraud Team\u201d. He informed my chap that a young lady (Demi Pike for what it\u2019s worth) had accidentally transferred him \u00a35 and he would need to transfer \u00a35 back to her account. \n\nI was half listening to the conversations and my alarm bells were ringing and red flags were up! I got \u2018shushed\u2019 when I said it didn\u2019t sound right AT ALL! The number they called phone was the correct Halifax phone number. My partner asked how he could confirm that this wasn\u2019t a scam... he was given a spiel on how it was legit as this scammer could confirm his security question - his mother\u2019s maiden. Again, it really didn\u2019t sound right to me but apparently he knew best and he sent the \u00a35 to the account he was told. He was then told he was going to be put on hold while the scammer confirmed the transfer.... the line went dead. I convinced him to ring THE LEGIT Halifax and let them know what had just happened. \n\nThe real Halifax lady checked his accounts and says \u201cAhh yes, I see a \u00a35000 withdrawal\u201d. This is when my partner knew he\u2019d f*cked up big time. After being sent to the REAL fraud department, he told his story and what had happened. The Halifax now then asks if he\u2019s had any suspicions calls/text beforehand \u201cOh actually, now you mention it - I had a weird text for EE but it wasn\u2019t their usual number. The text said I had to sign in through a link, so I did\u201d Guys, I love my chap more than anything but GODDAMN I facepalmed sooooo hard. \n\nLuckily Halifax have agreed that he\u2019s been a victim of fraud and will reimburse him of all the monies lost. He\u2019s reset all of his passwords and learnt his lesson. The Real Halifax lady said this may be a fairly new scam as she\u2019s never heard of having money put IN an account before draining it.",

I suppose it sets up a semi-believable excuse for the bank to call. I think also the EE text was a sort of \u2018test\u2019 to see who would fall for the actual big money scam.\n\nLesson learnt for him! When in doubt, HANG UP - all passwords have been changed to actually decent passphrases :)",

I was able to just change my password but the hacker set up 2 factor with a cellphone or Authenticator (which I didn\u2019t have turned on at first). So while my account is currently secure, I still can\u2019t get in without the 2 factor. I sent a note to support through the log-in screen of the app. The pictured email asked me to sent an image of my face holding up a piece of paper with a code written on it. I\u2019ve read that this is fairly typical for social accounts like this. But then today I got an email back (pictured above) from the mmmm asking for more info\u2026 to me it looks suspicious because \n- my iPhone writes them as \u201cFacebook\u201d, rather than insta\u2019\n- the jumbled email account makes me wary\n- they are asking for even more info, and very specific info\n- the ending of the email says thanks twice\u2026\n\nI know some of the above could be hashed out. Sometimes these support accounts are sent from form kind of corporate intranet and aren\u2019t ACTUALLY outlook email accounts, and the email signifier saying thanks twice could have just been laziness or an automatic signiture.\n\nDoes the email look familiar to anyone else? Am I being contacted by the hacker and not Instagram? What are your experiences with recovering an Instagram account?",

If you have an iPhone they are pretty easy to block with a few settings. \n\n1. Go to settings on your iPhone\n2. Scroll down and tap on \u2018Messages\u2019\n3. Scroll down and tap on \u2018Unknown & Spam\u2019\n4. Enable \u2018Filter Unknown Senders\u2019\n\nThis will turn off your notifications from unknown senders and their message goes straight to the junk tab in the messages app.\n\nI wrote this [article](https://donttext.app/blog/how-to-block-spam-texts-on-iphone/) as a guide for blocking spam texts. It contains more information about other settings for blocking spam, reporting junk messages, and how you can use my app to block spam texts.\n\nHope the article helps keep your phone free from spam!",

The app will prompt you to follow similar steps as the ones above so make sure you followed them correctly for the app to work. Then you can add keywords in the app and any text from a number not in your contacts will be blocked if it contains a keyword.\n\nThere is also a paid version that is completely optional. It saves you the hassle of setting keywords and will automatically detect and block spam texts for you (upgrade in the app).\n\nI hope this helps, for more information the article I linked in the original post explains how to use the app more in depth. If you love the app, leaving a review would be greatly appreciated and could help other people find the app so they can block spam too!",

Don't give it! Just wait.  \n- After 2-3 iterations, it will send you to a person.  \n- Tell them you DO NOT have an account with them, but your email address has been wrongly entered on someone else's account. They should remove your address.  \n- The person may tell you they can't do that. Escalate it to a manager. The manager can do it.  \n- I also begged them to contact the actual account holder and warn them. They said they would.\n\n(P.s. If they try to tell you to call the FTC's ID Theft division at 877.438.4338, don't bother, this is a waste of time. The FTC knows about this scam.

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nRecently I had a little car accident at the parking lot - hit another car with my door which damaged the paint on that car. I gave my phone number to a driver and left. 2 days later that driver called me to get my license number and full name because their insurance company required those details (from what they told me) which I provided.\n\nNext day I received a phone call from \"insurance claim company\" (didn't catch the name even thought I asked them to repeat it twice). They knew my name and the name of another driver (whose car I damaged). Seemed legit to me. They asked me to provide my vehicle rego number and the name of my insurance company, which I did (I feel **veeery** stupid for doing that). That was it, no more details asked.\n\n10 minutes later I'm getting a call from a different number, but supposedly the same \"insurance claim company\". This time it was a different guy who told me that previous call \"would be from another department\" (lol). Just like a previous caller, he knew the details of the accident. Next he tries to get my insurance claim number which he thought I have already claimed. I didn't have that number because I haven't made any claims yet and didn't even talk to my insurance. By that time it began to feel a bit fishy, so I hung up.\n\nI looked up bother phone numbers, one of which showed up as a scam agency. They also \"sell\" solar panels, surprise-surprise.\n\n**Questions**:\n\n1. What are the possible consequences of me releasing my car rego and insurer company name to those scammers? Except for them selling those details online of course.\n2. How do you think they knew about the accident and the names of both parties? I didn't talk to my insurance company, so they couldn't possibly leak it. However, another car's driver did report an accident to their insurer (from what they told me). Could the other driver's insurance company leak those details online? Within 24 hours of reporting it, lol?\n3. Tinfoil hat on: maybe that driver didn't call their insurance, but instead sold my license number, full name and phone number directly to scammers? And everyone is playing me?!?!?!?\n\nSorry for the long post. I've been caught off-guard this time and feel like I've lost the battle to idiots which makes me even bigger idiot.",

If money has been taken out of your account then yes you have been hacked and they have your credit card details and likely worse. What you need to do is call your bank and tell them to freeze the card and try to sort out a refund. You also need to think how this could have happened. Have you downloaded something sketchy or done something that could have compromised your accounts? Act fast or else you\u2019ll be in a whole world of pain\n\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention that you will need to change LITERALLY EVERY PASSWORD you have presuming that the rest of your important information hasn\u2019t been compromised.

So, I clicked the link which took my to a google form where I filled out my full name, age, phone number, address and email addresses both personal and school emails. After submitting the google form it told me to email this one email address listing my interests. While I was writing the email regarding my interests I realized it was a scam and deleted the mail I was writing. I never gave them my bank information and since changed my school email password and bank account passwords. A day later I changed all my passwords to my school email and all my bank accounts. Should I be okay or can scammers steal my identity or money just with my name, address, email and age?? Please help I\u2019m stressed.",

Asking if it is a real transaction. Not thinking, I click yes. It takes me to transactionverify.com. it tells me to call an 855 number (same area code as the Haworth store?) Who ask for the full credit card number at which point I hang up. The email was professional, the phone operator was professional. It was almost convincing.\n\n  \n\n\nShould I be concerned? They have my full name, email, and were able to swipe at least partial payment information from this store.",

        "selftext": "Last night/early this morning, I got a mention from someone and there was a Google link. Without thinking, I clicked it, but nothing seemed to happen. It just took me to Google. Then I remembered seeing an Atomic Shrimp video about phishing emails that could access your account just by you clicking the link. Since it went to Google, I immediately changed my Google password as a stop gap, and changed it to something better today (on a different browser). I also checked to see if it was logged in in a strange location. I changed the password for my Reddit account as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was going to take a screenshot of the mention to include, but when I went to check my mentions, it was already gone. I don't remember the account's name, just that it was probably a fake name with a stolen image of a woman, and only one post. The link itself was to Google, and after the address there was my user name and a bunch of other seemingly random characters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm also kinda curious if opening it in the internal browser (on Relay) would have done anything differently. Hopefully I did my due diligence (even after a stupid mistake) and I'm not at risk anymore?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(I did a cursory Google search about phishing on Reddit, but most of the results were subs on Reddit about phishing on other sites.)",

This probably happened through a third party app that was installed ( me being an idiot, yes i know). \nAs soon as I received the threat (the person is of course asking for money), I blocked the app in question and deleted it from my iphone, switched on VPN. \nSo, my phone number is not visible on telegram, also I am using eSIM at the moment with Hong Kong number as registered. \nOn the screenshot that I received, there is also visible IP address, which is no longer active (as I have vpn switched on since), so the ip address has in fact changed, and the indicated number there is not mine. However, I can recognize the numbers of my contacts, and are in fact real. \nAs I said, I\u2019m almost sure that my actual phone number is not compromised, but\u2026\nDuring this time (uninstall and blocking the app), there was ongoing communication with the person (me trying to negotiate). \nThe threat is that a 20s recording of video call is going to be sent. \nIf I did manage to stop remote connection by blocking and deleting the app and changing ip address very quickly, do I need to worry?\nThere was no reply after my last message, so I kind of hope that not being connected to my phone, they can\u2019t do much (I only hope, as my technical knowledge of this kind of things is not large\u2026). \nAlso there were no more threats for the last 14 hrs\u2026\nCan anybody help?\nThanks\u2026",

I knew it was a scam but I wanted to see what their angle was.\n\nAs expected they re routed me from Facebook messenger to What\u2019s App to speak to Bruce their hiring manager. I was given a number with a 213 area code. \n\nI started talking to Bruce and was given the \u201cparticulars\u201d about the job at Wayfair. I was told my job consisted of selling merchandise online and getting a commission based on my sales. \n\nHe then sent me a link to a fake Wayfair website -www.wayfairb.me- and told me to sign in using a username and password he gave me. I went to the community computer room in my building and used their public computer to visit the website. \n\nI put in the info he gave me and working 30 minutes of getting the job offer I was \u201cworking\u201d. He then told me there is a referral code where I can invite a friend and asked me to give him the code which I did. \nI did 26 \u201csales\u201d on this fake website and I was told that my account was low on funds and I can use his (meaning Bruce) personal account to continue selling merchandise. \n\nBruce gave me his log in info with user name and I logged into his account and continued \u201cworking\u201d. Eventually I got bored of the scammer and called him out.\n\nI\u2019m just wondering what type of scam is this? Were they trying to access my computer with this fake website? And was he trying to use the \u201ccodes\u201d to establish a network between his computer and the one I was using? \n\nThanks. ",

For \u201ctraining\u201d, I had to log in first under her account as she was the coach. Had to process 38 tasks (she received commission based on my processing). Did this 2 days along with processing 38 tasks a day under my own profile. At the end of the 2nd day, it froze my earnings and the coach said that I had to deposit $52 through the MetaMask app. I declined and blocked them on the WhatsApp.\n\n\n[Source](https://www.scampulse.com/wayfairbme-reviews)",

I've looked through this subreddit and seen similar emails, but this one came from MY email address.\n\nI'm actually worried because I have watched online videos and forgot to close my webcam. So theoretically this could be real. \n\nSo unfortunately I locked myself out of my email account for 24h by asking to reset it. That's why I don't have screenshots, and I can't check on the email to see if it's actually from my real email address or not.\n\nOne thing to note: I didn't have anything in my 'sent' box. I tried sending an email to myself as a test, and it appeared, so technically the scanner's email should have appeared in my sent box as well if this was real?\n\nPlease help!!",

This accounts for the vast majority of email-based sextortion attempts. You could change your email password and make sure MFA is enabled, to be on the safe side of things.\n\n2. POSSIBLE - Scammer did in fact hack your account, send said email, then deleted the email from your Sent Items folder. User may or may not have \"incriminating\" videos/pictures of you. Just reset your password, set up MFA, make sure none of your passwords to any of your services match, and you're good.\n\n3. UNLIKELY, BUT IT DOES HAPPEN - Same as #2, but with the added whammy that the hacker did in fact get videos/pictures of you. Same actions required as #2, but disconnect any computers in your local network now, back up all of your data to cold storage (an external hard drive, for example) and consider doing a wipe/reinstall of the OS on all computers. r/sextortion is a good resource for situations like this. They generally say to never try to contact the scammer and to go off-grid (social media wise, such as deactivating/deleting all of your accounts) for a month or so. Watch out for sketchy people trying to friend you on social media once you go back on grid, and pay no attention/mind if they try to put pressure on you to pay or threaten to send files to friends/family/coworkers.",

If you\u2019ve already drawn against the credit, you are now in debt to the bank, and worst of all, your cash is locked in gift cards on their way to a scammer. \n\nThe scam in this post is interesting bc Bancorp South is a US bank, and the instructions were written by someone who is very fluent in English and has knowledge of Walmart business practices. The demand for getting 3 consecutive orders from the same cashier is a technique that is meant to evade security controls for fraudulent transactions. The point is, this is more advanced than I typically see. They are evolving.",

Phew :). My question still stands.\n\n[Colleague's Name.html](https://preview.redd.it/mlyk6rmwnpa81.png?width=913&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5e368654e5cdb188b0be665d1c02d8f05cf1d53)",

They said that the malware remains invisible for antivirus software. They are asking me for a lot of money and then they promise to delete the harmful software. They want bitcoin. They said not to tell anyone or contact the police or security services or they will reveal my data and videos. They also said throwing away my devices is useless. They said that once they receive the money they won't contact e ever again and that they promise. I really don't know what to do. I am really scared, please help me and give me advice. I am really thinking of committing suicide. I am writing from another device right now. I forgot to say that they said I have 2 days to send the money or the data will be leaked, so by Tuesday afternoon EST. ",

Unless you download something sketchy it\u2019s very hard to get malware on a pc. Drive by attacks have gotten a lot harder and usually game hacks and shit are where malware spreads. If you need to use something sketchy run it in a virtual machine. Malware is scary because a lot of people aren\u2019t educated at all on it. Outside of rare zero days which are used by governments the spread methods are pretty simple. If you scan and your still worried you can always reinstall windows, doing so is often kinda refreshing if you have a lot of bloat. Finally they would 100% run a screen locker or random ware if they got in your system. I write pretty basic malware in rust and c# just for fun, but you can easily make a screen locker in visual studio by making a big image and turning off show in taskbar. If your paranoid like me switch to Linux and for the love of god don\u2019t jack off in front of your camera. Just to make it clear everyone gets these they are automated and really easy to make and it\u2019s impossible to steal an email account and drop malware from it. Unless they butt fucked the email service and found a gigs brain exploit it is completely impossible to execute commands to someone\u2019s pc by stealing an email account.",

Something like [https://jn--vcasecwiuewugf47gfwg-fdoiuwfc.blogspot.com/lkjcwhec98w4g7432gcw7cgw98g](https://jn--vcasecwiuewugf47gfwg-fdoiuwfc.blogspot.com/lkjcwhec98w4g7432gcw7cgw98g). The reddit user has no history and regged a few days ago. I searched blogspot.com and it doesn't seem to exist anymore, google and wiki sent me to blogger?\n\nIs there anything to worry about? Can the real URL be fake too? I don't want to click it again. I use ZA and Avast (did smart scan and nothing showed up) and nothing popped up. I also deleted all my cookies, history etc. Thanks!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: the link posted in the og post is just something I made up that was similar, this is the real one but I didnt post since I'm not sure if it's dangerous/NSFW/ETC..\n\n[https://xn--qp317vcase5ltpaa344ic4n3-qjtedak.blogspot.com/?0N42CZnPSE12cfCksFcRT9hklqtpC4lxqIhwzVw8Mw0GjHb9o](https://xn--qp317vcase5ltpaa344ic4n3-qjtedak.blogspot.com/?0N42CZnPSE12cfCksFcRT9hklqtpC4lxqIhwzVw8Mw0GjHb9o)",

The thing is, I don't have a BlockFi account. \n\nThe e-mail was really short, just providing a 6-digit code, and asking to respond to the e-mail or call a number if I had any questions. It looked kind of sketchy, but it came from the e-mail blockfi@support.com so I thought it might be legit. \n\nI searched up BlockFi, and submitted a ticket with them, saying that someone may be trying to set up an account using my e-mail. The automated e-mail that ticket generated was from a completely different e-mail from the original one I received: support@blockfi.zendesk.com. So  that led me to the assumption that the original e-mail I got was some sort of scam, and that I would have been in trouble if I responded to the e-mail or called the number. \n\nI'm going to check my credit report in the morning, to see if someone has been trying to get loans under my name too.\n\nBut are there other steps I should take? Does this look like a phishing scam to everyone else?",

        "selftext": "So, I never thought I\u2019d dumb enough for falling for a thing like this. \n\nI was on Facebook and someone recommended a live video to me. A live video from a famous German singer. \n\nIt said the first 200 people telling the correct number (on a picture next to him) get 5000\u20ac. \nYa I know, should have been the first indicator...\n\nSo, I posted the number in the comments. Cause you know, it was the real singer!\n\nAfter a while he posted a link in the comments, saying we have to click it to get the money. (I know!!!! Silly me!)\n\nIt said to put in the credit card details. No charge. (...). But hey, it was the real singer, why would it be scam?! (Yep...)\n\nSo I clicked on the link. Filled in my name and credit card details. (So so so dumb)\n\nIt said it didn\u2019t work. I did it again. If I reflect it correctly, there appeared another site. Again: name and credit card details. I made an account. \n\nIt said to confirm the charge of 1\u20ac off my credit card. For verification... (aaaaaaahhhhhhhhh)\n\nYes, I did that as well. Got a verification code from my bank and typed it in. \n\nThen it said to sign up for a free 5 day trial on rollermedia.net\n\nDid that as well...\n\nBack on Facebook:\n\nSinger posts in the group \u201cShare in 10 groups to get your money\u201d\n\nTHEN, and only THEN, I became suspicious. I clicked on his profile. And you guesses right. Fake. New account. Not official. S.C.A.M.\n\nSo, I logged into my bank and immediately blocked my credit card. \n\nI received and email from rollermedia, confirming my 5 day trial and then continuing with 55$ a month!\n\nI logged in and deleted my account. I quite wondered that it worked. \n\nI took screenshots of everything. \n\nI feel so so so very silly!!! So many times I saw things like that and couldn\u2019t believe that people really fall for it. And now I did it myself... my only excuse is stress, dehydration and lack of sleep. :-(\n\nOh gosh!!!!\n\nAnyway:\n\nDo you think I\u2019m safe? Or can I be prosecuted? I mean, I signed Agree with terms and conditions. \n\nIs there anything else I could do? Could there be anything on my phone now? I didn\u2019t download anything though. \n\nMy card is blocked. As I wrote, I think there was another page and I can\u2019t really recall if I signed up on two different things. \n\nIF I did, they can\u2019t get money off my bank, because I blocked my card. But can they demand it from me because I signed up for something?\n\nI took a screenshot of rollermedia saying I deleted my account. But I didn\u2019t get a confirmation email.",

He checked online and some website said talk to the websites live chat team and ask for refund and he went to the website and talked and  gave them his 16digit debit card number. 33$ came back and another 39$ was taken from the account from another website. And again he went to that website and did the same thing again. Money ain't back still and I don't think it's coming back. \n\nI made him call the bank and told them what happened and they said it's all good we will cancel the debit card and issue a new one in 5 days or whatever. He did put in his email address and mobile number too along with the stuff he gave the scam website and he had all the payment methods saved in chrome too. I went and deleted all that and going to change all the passwords he had linked to his email and he did get a WhatsApp message saying this is from the police and they caught him for sex trade and he is fined a big amount and all that shit. Which I think is a scam too. Hopefully nothing else \n\nSorry for the big text but I want to know what all I should do to help him secure everything now. Like changing passwords and authenticator is one thing but wat else can I do ?? And what are the damage these people can do with the credentials they have. Any help is appreciated.",

        "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI'm an IT admin and had one of my clients send me a copy of this kind of phishing email and I'm wondering just where it may have come from. The contents are clearly a phishing scam:\n\n\"\ud83d\udda8\ufe0fAttn: XXXXXXXXXXXX\n\n**-You have an important\u00a0XXXXXXXXXXXX designated Document-**   \n\n\nIt was scanned and sent to you \\[XXXXXXXXXXXX\\] using a Xerox WorkCentre multifunction\u00a0device on Microsoft\u00a0Exchange Portal.   \n\n\nFor more XXXXXXXXXXXX-specific information as it relates to you, please visit XXXXXXXXXXXX\n\n**Retrieve Document**\"\n\nI've X'd out any emails and links that look like they would belong to my client's domain, when they clearly don't. The \"please visit\" link is actually something like this: \"[crixerox-secondary.z15.web.core.windows.net](https://crixerox-secondary.z15.web.core.windows.net)\". It takes you to a fake Outlook Web App login page.\n\nThis is what gets me:\n\n1. At this particular client's location we've never had a Xerox printer until a week ago. Prior to that it's been all Epson and we never had emails like this.\n2. I installed the Xerox printer myself and I disabled the Xerox cloud service, all the ports and protocols, except for the very necessary to get printing working in that particular location. I also installed the drivers (.INF based, not the .exe installer) myself on the workstations.\n3. In addition, the whole network is firewall completely, only allowing VPN connections from the outside with logging and all that. There's no way someone would have just scanned the network remotely.\n4. I'm suspecting one of the computers might have some sort of spyware installed? I have no other theory for why specifically a \"Xerox\" phishing email arrived in my client's inbox. Ideas where to look?\n\nThank you!",

There's not much she can do other than try to get into those accounts and alert her contacts that that is not her and it's a scammer. Or you could email on her behalf to some contacts she may remember? The fact she gave out her credentials is huge and depending what that email is attached to there could be major trouble unless you guys take action ASAP.",

I didn't see any harm in confirming I made the order but I know now it was a scam call so I have no idea what they gain from calling me and confirming that I made that order. I am very worried especially about my privacy as what I purchased was very sensitive and private. \n\nWhat could they possibly gain from calling me and confirming it was me who made the purchase?\n\nbtw I have contacted Amazon and they have confirmed it was not them.",

        "selftext": "The number +1-888-274-5552 represents a new yet old front in fraudulent phishing in Canada. The scam artist physically prints fake letters similar to and imitating CIBC bank of Canada or any other bank.\n\nThe letter is physically dropped at a victim's residential address. The letter has a fake Canada Post stamp on it, that was printed by a laser printer and looks like the letter is genuine. But the letter is fake with logos for the bank. The letter says the victim's account is closed and provides the number +1-888-274-5552 to call.\n\nWhen the victim calls, they pretend to verify account number by asking usual security questions that banks ask like DOB, SIN, and bank PIN code number etc.  Usually the Victim has already been identified as being a CIBC customer or a customer belonging to the bank they are targeting.\n\nThe targeted victim usually has a good credit rating and has banking products with CIBC or the targeted bank. If the Victim's name is 'John Smith', the would intentionally misspell the victim's name to  something like 'jones Smith'. This entices the victim to want to call and correct it, believing that there must be a genuine error resulted from a customer with a similar name to theirs. Inside the letter, at the letter head it will have the correct phone numbers for CIBC, but at the bottom of the letter it asks the Victim to call CIBC divestiture department not customer service department.\n\nThe letter also contains a self addressed envelope to CIBC's correct mailing address, but the self Addresses envelope has a fake printed electronic return stamp.  This make's it appear more genuine.  When the Victim calls the number, the fraud artist is looking to get the Victim's Banking PIN code.\n\nVery often the SCAMMERS already have the Victim's Credit details, but what they need is the Victim's Banking PIN code. So when the victim calls, they often provide to the victim, partial information such as...your Credit card number is 666667788, please tell us the last 4 digits.\n\nThe Victim then thinks that indeed this is CIBC bank, because they already have ther banking Details. Then They will Hang up with the victim, Tell the Victim the usual bullshit like Thank you for banking with CIBC etc and ask the victim not to call the bank back but allow 5 Business to process whatever it is they claimed.\n\nAnd they would call the Victim back.  So the victim will call their real Bank 5 days later, but the Fraud has already happened. If you receive such a letter call the police, drop it off at a police station, the scam artist may have been careless and still have left finger prints on it. Or drop it off to your CIBC branch or your bank.\n\nSO BE WARE WHEN YOU GET A LETTER FROM THIS NUMBER: +1-888-274-5552",

So if the victims are asked to dial that number to call on the fake letter that is supposed to be a scam as indicated in the post, then the victims are going to reach CIBC Fulfillments and Investigations Department so I don\u2019t know how that would end up being a scam.  My information comes from calling the CIBC Contact Centre with account related questions and the agent saif that I should contact this department and gave to me that 888 number to call.  I then tried to do some research in Google by typing in that phone number and the first searches are CIBC Website Links mostly concerning Fraud and then I found this post.  I was hoping to be able to find what a Fulfillments and Investigations Department \u00ab\u00a0does\u00a0\u00bb within a bank but was unable to find the true meaning of that\u2026 and I ended up stumbling on this post.  All to say that if the CIBC Contact Centre itself is giving out that 888 number to individuals then I hardly doubt that the 888 number is going to result in an individual ending up being the victim of fraud.  And as well, no bank is ever going to request that a customer reveals their PIN Number and nonetheless\u2026 a PIN Number is fairly useless to anyone if the one requesting is not in possession of the Debit Card or Credit Card associated with that PIN Number !!",

The price of your subscription service may change.\n\nTerms Applicable to All Paid Subscriptions, except Special Promotion Subscriptions\u00a0\nYour paid subscription will renew automatically for a subsequent term of equal length until you cancel, and a subscription fee and applicable tax will be deducted from your wallet (or for Vue subscriptions, from your Amazon Pay account, if applicable) at the\u00a0start of each renewal term. If your wallet has insufficient funds, your account\u2019s default payment method will be charged. To cancel, follow the instructions under \u201cHow to Cancel a Subscription\u201d below. The price of your subscription service may change.\u00a0\n\nTerms Applicable to Limited-Time Promotion Subscriptions\nUnless you cancel during the promotional period, your subscription will renew automatically as a monthly subscription and the regular subscription fee and applicable tax will be deducted from your wallet each month until you cancel. If your wallet has insufficient\u00a0funds, your account\u2019s default payment method will be charged. To cancel, follow the instructions under \u201cHow to Cancel a Subscription\u201d below. The price of your subscription service may change.\n\n*The subscription fee shown may reflect a PS Plus member discount. A PS Plus member discount will apply to a subscription fee charge only if, at the time of the charge, you\u2019re a current PS Plus member and the discount is in effect. If you\u2019re not a current PS\u00a0Plus member or no discount is in effect at the time of a renewal charge, you\u2019ll be charged the then-applicable regular subscription fee.How to Cancel a Subscription\n\nCancelling from a PS4\u2122 system:\nSign in to PlayStation\u00aeNetwork then go to [Settings] > [Account Management] > [Account Information] > [PlayStation Subscriptions].

        "selftext": "I got a super convincing phishing email last night that I almost fell for this morning when I was checking my email. It contained a pdf and the email itself was claiming to be from the circuit court stating that I was being sued in a civil case and all the details were in the attachment.\n\nMultiple red flags made me stop and do some double-checking without having to interact with the file:\n\n1: **Checked The Domain** - First thing I did was check the domain. I searched for the domain on google and looked for official Florida state court websites that contained references to the domain. The domain itself was not resolving to a page.\n\n2: **Searched for Official Mentions of the Domain**- After not finding any hints of the domain on official sites, I checked the whois registry to see when it was registered, assuming that the circuit courts would use long-existing domains. The domain was registered about a year ago on NAMECHEAP.\n\n3: **Questioned the instructions** - The email was explicitly telling me to open the file to find out info about the case. This seemed very strange to me, as the email contained a lot of other seemingly associated information. So why would they put the rest of the info in the pdf instead of plain text?\n\n4:  **Searched for Case Details on Official Websites** - Searched The email contained a case number, which I then searched for on official Florida court databases to no avail.\n\n5): **Noticed Weird Text Patterns in the Plain-Text** - The text in the email was very well written, but it was broken in weird places. Kind of  \nLike this.\n\n6): **Looked Closer at the Details** - The location of the hearing referenced in the email was \"Florida County Circuit Court\" (There is no Florida County)\n\nI ended up calling the circuit court after going through it and confirmed that it was a phishing attempt. \n\nThat being said, this was a very well crafted phishing email and I would have fallen for it if I wasn't on my toes. So keep an eye out for emails from the domain ***rocnp\\[.\\]com.***\n\nI'm thinking about wiping an old laptop and using it to analyze malicious files like that in a virtual sandbox environment. If that's something you'd like to see, let me know cause it will take a good chunk of time to set up, but I get enough phishing emails and I'm big into cyber security so this seems like a fun project.",

        "selftext": "**Subject: Google Extension Virus Hack (tTabs Extension, OOBLE Virus)**\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI recently went through a very harrowing and traumatic experience with an online hacker, and I understand how confusing and scary this can be. If this happened to you too, I want to help you as much as I can. Here\u2019s what you need to know:\n\n# Important: Read This Message If This Happened to You\n\n**ATTENTION**: Do not respond to or engage with the hacker. The blackmail they are sending you is a scam (even though the hack is real) and engaging with them is potentially dangerous. I also highly recommend not opening any file attachments they send you, as these could potentially contain other unwanted cyber threats.\n\nIf this happened to you, don't worry, you're not alone and everything is going to be okay. The person who did this to you is a terrible person and you probably feel very angry and emotional right now. What this person did to you is absolutely wrong and you have every right to feel the way that you do. Your anger and hatred towards this person are completely justified.\n\n# My Experience:\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago, on May 23rd, this happened to me too. And, I'm here to help as much as I can. Let's put an end to this hack. But first, let's make sure you know what to do to remove this virus from your computer and make sure you know what to do to secure your accounts.\n\n* **Hacking Incident**: My computer got infected by a virus I downloaded unintentionally. This led to unauthorized access to several of my online accounts, including Amazon, Discord, YouTube, Github, and Facebook.\n* **Unauthorized Activities**: The hacker used my information to make unauthorized purchases and spread the virus further by creating posts on my accounts.\n* **Ransom Note**: I received a ransom note via email, demanding money in exchange for my personal information and access to my accounts.\n\n# What is the OOBLE Virus?\n\nI'm giving it a name because it needs one. I am calling it the OOBLE virus because these are the first 5 letters of the file name this virus was contained in on my computer.\n\nHere's what it is: The virus you downloaded on your computer (aka the OOBLE Virus) is a Google Extension Virus. The good news is, Google Extension Viruses are easy to remove from your computer (as long as you follow a proper step-by-step guide on how to remove them). The bad news is, since it is a Google extension that scrapes all of your data from your Google browser (mainly login info like emails, usernames, and passwords), the person who hacked you now has access to all of this information about you. There is a very high chance that any Google account you've ever logged into on your computer is now compromised. This is what makes this virus feel so world-ending and like someone else is controlling your life. That's why the first thing you need to do is start changing all of your passwords from a secure device that is not infected.\n\n# Here's a Step-by-Step Guide on Exactly What to Do if You Have a Google Extension Virus:\n\n**Step 1: Secure Your Google Accounts (and any other logins like bank account logins that are stored in your Google account)**\n\nTURN OFF YOUR COMPUTER (or whatever your infected device is) and use something else (like your phone or iPad) to start securing your accounts and changing all your passwords. Remember, they can only retrieve data about you from your infected device.\n\nAsk yourself, what have I logged into on my computer recently? Netflix? Hulu? Facebook? TikTok? YouTube? Bank Accounts? You need to change the password for everything you can think of. I know this can be very overwhelming, so if you can't think of everything, it's okay. Start with your most important accounts first. Definitely make sure you change your password for your Gmail accounts.\n\n**Step 2: Remove the Virus Manually from Your Computer**\n\nGo on YouTube and search for \"Google Extension Virus.\" Several YouTube videos will pop up that explain what these viruses are and give you step-by-step instructions on how to remove these viruses from your computer. You have to do this yourself because they are installed in hidden folders on your computer that antivirus software can't see.\n\nBasically, what you need to do for this is boot your computer into safe mode so you can open your computer registry and delete the virus manually. Mine was in my AppData folder and all I had to do to remove it was click on the correct folder containing the virus and then click delete. And just like that, the virus was gone.\n\n**Tracing the Virus to a Source Location:**\n\nYou do not need to be in safe mode to do this. I actually don't even know if it's possible to do this in safe mode since you need the virus to be running in your browser to trace it.\n\nTo find where the virus is hiding on your computer, go to the extension (in this case, tTabs) and click \"Details.\" From here, you should be able to see a very long file ID number. Something like ooblegaopweigeogiarnpoifdkglibgvnmwevoi (I can't remember the whole thing so I just mashed keys on my keyboard to create a similar file name).\n\nThen open your File Explorer and go navigate to your Profile folders using this path: `C:\\Users\\Your Name\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Profile`\n\nUnder the folder \"Profile 1\" (this could also be Profile 2, Profile 16, Profile 27, etc.) you should see a folder with the same exact ID that matches the ID from the Google extension (here that ID is ooblegaopweigeogiarnpoifdkglibgvnmwevoi). This is the folder containing the virus that needs to be deleted from your computer's registry. When you are editing your registry, you will need to make sure you delete this folder under every single profile it is in (yes, it can be in multiple profiles at the same time).\n\nIf you don't know how to do this, you can go on YouTube and find a step-by-step guide on how to do this properly.\n\n**Step 3: Remove the Google Extension from Your Browser**\n\nYou will need to do this for every single Google profile that is on your computer. I did this on my computer by logging into each account I have on Google Chrome one by one, clicking on the 3 dots in the top right corner, and going into my extensions settings. From there, you should be able to remove the extension the hacker installed on your computer.\n\nYou might be thinking, wait what? So, the way this virus works is that they install a program onto your computer that automatically installs a Google extension in your browser every time you log into a new Google account in Google Chrome. This is why you need to remove the virus from your registry before you do this part. Otherwise, the program they installed on your computer with the hack will just keep reinstalling the extension that scrapes your data into Google Chrome.\n\n**Helpful Info:**\n\nThe Extension from the hack on my computer was called \"tTabs.\" I will use tTabs as an example. If you need to remove tTabs (after you delete the virus from your registry) you can click on \"Remove\" under tTabs in your Google extensions settings.\n\n**Step 4: Recover Suspended Social Media Accounts**\n\nIf your Facebook account was disabled there is an email address you can contact to request that they disable it and explain your situation. This happened to me and I have not heard back from them yet, but Facebook Support is so bad that I wanted to make sure to post this here in case anyone else needs this info.\n\n**Facebook Support Email for Disabled Profiles**: `disabled@fb.com`: For help recovering disabled or hacked accounts, password resets, or page access issues\n\n# Immediate Steps to Take:\n\n1. **Do Not Pay the Ransom**:\n   * Paying the ransom does not guarantee that you will regain access to your accounts, and it may encourage further malicious behavior.\n2. **Run an Antivirus Scan**:\n   * Use reputable antivirus software to scan your computer and remove any detected threats. Ensure your antivirus software is up to date. I personally used Malwarebytes.\n3. **Change Your Passwords**:\n   * Change passwords for all your online accounts, especially those that were compromised. Use strong, unique passwords for each account.\n   * Consider using a password manager to generate and store secure passwords.\n4. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**:\n   * Enable FA on all accounts that support it. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification in addition to your password.\n5. **Check for Unfamiliar Apps and Extensions**:\n   * Review the apps installed on your devices and the extensions in your web browsers. Remove any that you do not recognize or trust.\n\n# Contacting Support:\n\n* **Facebook**: If your Facebook account was disabled, contact Facebook support to explain the situation and request account recovery. Provide as much detail as possible, including account details and the circumstances of the hack.\n* **Other Services**: Contact support for other affected services (Amazon, Discord, YouTube, etc.) to report the unauthorized activity and seek assistance with securing your accounts.\n\n# Securing Your Devices:\n\n1. **Review App Permissions**:\n   * Go to your device settings and review the permissions granted to each app. Revoke any unnecessary permissions.\n2. **Backup Important Data**:\n   * Regularly back up important data to a secure location, such as an external hard drive or a trusted cloud service.\n3. **Update Software**:\n   * Ensure your operating system and all applications are up to date with the latest security patches.\n\n# Additional Tips:\n\n* **Be Cautious with Downloads**: Only download files and software from trusted sources. Be wary of email attachments and links from unknown senders.\n* **Monitor Your Accounts**: Keep an eye on your bank accounts and other financial accounts for any suspicious activity. Report any unauthorized transactions immediately.\n* **Educate Yourself**: Stay informed about common security threats and best practices for protecting your online privacy.\n\nI hope this information helps you secure your accounts and provides some peace of mind. Remember, you are not alone in this, and there are steps you can take to regain control of your online presence. ",

        "selftext": "So I\u2019ve been getting a lot of realistic emails and phone calls from Citi Bank saying I have applied for a card and it was accepted and being shipped to me, even though I have NEVER even so much as even thought about getting a Citi card. The street address in the email was correct, and they even left me a message with a callback number and reference number. I tried calling the callback numbers and it just says called failed.\n\nI also tried contacting Citi Bank directly about this from the number listed on their website and not only was the fraud prevention agent very rude and extremely hard to hear due to a terrible quality mic, they demanded my ssn, which I refused to share. I work in tech and know a phish when I see one, so despite how realistic and accurate these calls and emails seem to be I have to assume it is phishing. Citi bank support absolutely sucks and is totally unhelpful. I looked up the email domains and phone numbers and most posts/sites seem to say they\u2019re not fraudulent?\n\nFYI, the emails usually come from alerts@info6.citi.com or Citibank.Message@info15.citi.com and the phone numbers were 8664933599 and +1 (866) 299-2421. Hoping this will at least find someone who\u2019s also experiencing this, and if anyone has a similar experience please shed some light!",

He says he got access to my accounts and files so why doesn't he just steal my bank money? \nAnd who the fuck would infect someone's phone for all of this, and then just remove the malware? He even gave me tips to protect my stuff, is he a hacker or an angel? lmao\nI don't think this is real, but it scared the shit out of me... is there a way for them to send messages with my email like that? \nI use Hotmail, I decided to remove the password and use a 2 step notification (even though I've been using it since months ago).",

Just a quick note to share some news that might surprise you.\nOn the day of 25/03/2023 13:08:23\n, I penetrated your device's operating system and seized total control of your account \"my name\n\". I've been keeping a thorough watch on you for a long time.\n\nI've introduced software into your system that grants me dominion over all your devices.\nThrough the malware I've deployed, I've gained control over your device's primary functions such as your microphone, video camera, keyboard, and display. I've moved all your personal data, photos, and browsing history to my servers. I now have access to all your messaging apps, social media accounts, emails, synced data, chat histories, and contact lists.\nIt's quite interesting what I've found about you!\n\nIntriguing thoughts flooded my mind about the applications of this data...\nA fascinating idea has recently come to mind: using artificial intelligence to create a split-screen video. On one side, you're engaged in masturbate  , and on the other, you're interacting with an intriguing website. Videos of this nature are rapidly gaining popularity.\n\nThe result? Totally knocked my socks off.\n\nWith a single click, I can distribute this video to all your contacts through email, social networks, and instant messengers. Furthermore, I could expose access to all the emails and messaging apps you use.\nAdditionally, I found a plethora of intriguing materials that I could disseminate online and share with friends.\n\nIf you don't want me to do it, send me 1250 $ (US dollar) to my Bitcoin wallet.\nMy BTC address:\nbc1qnurm5wx3r7enmvnn087g0e3u9mwepw8jn6d035\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with how to fund a Bitcoin wallet, you can always use Google for help. It's quite straightforward.\nUpon receipt of the funds, I will promptly eliminate all unwanted material. Subsequently, we will go our separate ways. I pledge to deactivate and remove all malware from your devices without fail. You can have complete confidence in me; I stand firmly behind my words. This agreement is fair, particularly given the significant time and effort I have dedicated to tracking your profile and traffic.\n\nYou have exactly two days (48 hours) from the time this letter is opened to make the payment.\n\nAfter this period, if I don't receive the specified amount from you, I'll distribute access to your accounts, visited sites, personal data, and edited videos to everyone, without any warning.\n\nRemember. I don't make mistakes. I would advise against taking this lightly; I have many resources at my disposal.\n\nThere's no point complaining about me because they can't find me. Formatting the drive or destroying the device won't help because I already have your data.\n\nAny responses to this email will not be reviewed or seen, as it is not a personal account and does not receive replies.\n\n\n\n\nGood luck, and don't let this upset you!\n\nEach person has their line of work, today you just happened to be on the wrong end of mine.\n\n\n\n\nP.S. A word to the wise - in the future, ensure you follow the safety norms of the internet and abstain from dodgy websites.\n\nIdentificator your device: ////////(cannot share)\n\n\nOperating system:  Windows 10 Home x64\n\n\n\nAvailable keyboard layouts:\nItalian (Italy)\nEnglish (United States)\n\n\n\nAntiviruses:\nWindows Defender\nAvast\n\nand sent various passwords of mine and a screenshot of me playing roblox lmao\"",

        "selftext": "Hi, first post here on Reddit and I'd really need some help with the dumbest thing I've probably ever done. I haven't slept in two days, so when I saw a fake ad for my country's national train service \"to win a 150 bucks worth of a gift card paying 2\" I fell for it like a dumbass. I swear, I'm actually a very safe tech savvy person, but tiredness (and the need to have something like that) made me act on impulse.   \nSo, I did everything the scammer wanted (did the fake \"winning game\", got the fake reward and I had to send my info. The thing is, I only put the most general ones (name, address, cellphone and one email as I have several) and no card info put. And when I tried to go on with the site, my cellphone security system blocked everything and self-forced my phone to close the scam page. Now, the thing is if they got my email adress (no password given  tho and no money was sent) they could have got the general info of my pre-paid card but that's all there is. I don't have a bank account, nor a credit card, just a pre-paid card of a public service (which has currently 1 buck and 30 cents, yeah, I'm not doing very well). I changed said email password, deleted any photos on my phone, anything. I know they'll most probably sell my personal info to someone at this point, but I'm scared they'll use my data to give me debt about some who-knows-what in some part of the world. What should I do? I'm so terribly scared right now, especially because, as I said, I never fell for these tricks! (It doesn't help that my father fell for this sort of things already and apparently he received \"a weird sms from me\", which makes me even more nervous right now). Please, help. ",

The way you can tell this is if you've lost all cell service on your phone, if you're still able to send and receive calls/texts, you're likely fine \n\nBut since you said you don't have a bank account, your main concern is more likely being a target for further phishing attempts, likely SMS related and pretty personal since they have your name as well as number. \n\nDepending on what you accessed the site with, I would also get an anti-virus or 2 to do a deep scan of the device, phishing sites sometimes drop malicious files upon visiting.\n\nHope this helps even a tiny bit lol",

Purchase was made, I open the email to get my code and antivirus tells me about this weird virus and\u2026there was another warning from january(before the ffxiv thing) and it was identical, same name, file location and file name.\n I checked the amazon emails and both seem legit, I may have opened an scam email on my computer in the last months but I\u2019m certain I haven\u2019t clicked on any link so I don\u2019t know how I got it.

After I run this rule (which has to be done manually) all I'm left with in junk are mistakes (not junk) or garden variety Spam.",

        "selftext": "Sorry for cross-posting in a few places.  I have been obsessed and worried and just want to know if anyone can help with some questions.  Recently I received a Google Drive file talking about crypto which contained a link with a Scripts.Google link.  As someone who has never knew of the google drive scams I just figured it would go to some website asking for info. I didn't believe google could or even would host something on their URL that could be bad.  I clicked the link and it went to a white page before I quickly exited and reset my phone to factory within an hour. I run 3 different anti-malware programs when I got it back up.  I have been researching malware/phishing/scams done through Google Drive for the past few days and I constantly am seeing different reports.  Some mention revoking access from google drive to your account which mine never had and I have seen others talk about files downloading which I didn't have either. I have 2FA on pretty much everything but I have went and changed multiple passwords.\n\nThe day after I accidentally clicked it. I received another Google Drive document the next day from a similar name mentioning I didn't complete whatever they wanted me to do and sent another scripts.google link.  It looked like it was possibly longer but I didn't click it.  I reported and blocked the account. I do not have either link and all because I have cleared my entire google account. \n\nThe pinned mod post was helpful but I am curious on does anyone know what these scripts.google links typically do? Does it only work on PC or does it work on Androids? Copy the entire phone? Copy Texts/Emails? Skim through looking for files with credentials? Copy Passwords saved to account? Is it something goes for biometrics?",

I'm sure it was a malware link or a virus. What should I do? Is my personal information already stolen and my phone permanently bugged?\n\n1. Opened up a link someone sent me through telegram private messages phone almost immediately my phone started to work slowly and then increasingly buggy within a matter of seconds.\n2. The person claimed to be a hacker since 2019\n3. My phone is a android with the average social media apps and banking apps.\n4. I quickly shut off my phone and took out my sim card\n5. Unsure what to do at this point\n6. Update: Turned phone back on (Did not put sim card back in) phone is running completely normal also ran multiple phone scans for malware/new apps and everything came back clear and checked browser for any downloads also clear.

I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on there, but something tells me that those are the real things so I think we should try to reach out and put those addresses  somewhere, maybe we can make a telegram group and see if we can connect the other wallets and acquire all the signatures that the multi sink requires so that we can transfer something they probably did it so that we could come together like a mission or something because that\u2019s only thing we need to do is connect with the other signatures so let\u2019s look and see what signatures are left and then see if they\u2019re in the wallet that they have the pass keys to  so let\u2019s find a way to organize together guys.

Possibly people who receive these wallets don't realize they are multi sig and think they just need gas money to transfer the coins out. So they put a small amount in for the transfer fee and then realize they can't transfer any of the tron or their transfer fee back out. If I remember correctly (it's been a while I had forgotten about this) there were multiple small transactions in and then a larger transaction out. \n\nI'd imagine the wallet that is being transferred too is the wallet that holds the second sig. I highly doubt they would mistakenly send that out. \n\nI still fail to see how this is a profitable scam. There must be something I'm missing.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone!  Hoping I can find some help -\n\nI do NOT have an Ally account, have never had an Ally account and have not opened one.  Tonight I received an e-mail confirming a new account has been opened, another confirming a new Zelle contact was added to this account and a third confirming a $1400 check deposit was made.  The e-mail account listed as the Zelle contact is not my e-mail address.  My main e-mail is firstname.lastname at a popular mail service; the Zelle contact allegedly added includes my first name, a few numbers and is at another popular mail service that I have never used.\n\nThe e-mails look pretty legit, though I know e-mail addresses can be easily spoofed.  There are no errors or obvious indicators of phishing that I can see.  I opened a new browser tab to go to the Ally site (did not use a link from the email) to see if I could do a username/password recovery to access an account associated with my real e-mail address, but Ally wants you to call if you can't remember your username, and they require a social security number to reset a password.  And since I have no intention of giving out my social during this debacle if I can help it, I settled on forwarding the e-mail to their \"fraud\" group and calling them.\n\nI am now 30 minutes into a 2 hour hold time, and am trying to figure out what I can do in the meantime to protect my real money in my actual bank accounts, as I'm concerned if the Zelle deposit bounces and payments are made against it that they'll try and withdraw from my other existing accounts or come after me.  I deactivated Zelle completely from one of my bank accounts; another bank has Zelle set up, but won't let me deactivate it online, so I pointed it to a savings account that only has $5 in it just in case.\n\nHas anyone seen this before?  I tried searching online but didn't see anything about this kind of scam, all I really found about Ally scams are fake fraud alerts.\n\nAnd is there anything else I should do to protect myself?  My credit reports are all frozen, so not super worried there, but I'm worried there's something I'm not thinking about.\n\nThanks in advance!!",

        "selftext": "I 've used gmail for years and, for the most part, I have managed to keep spam mail to a dull roar, i.e. generally only mail from legitimate companies' mailing lists that I purposely or accidentally signed up for while shopping or whatever. However...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently, and all of a sudden, I began to get a handful of definite scam emails a day. It should be mentioned that I am generally quite careful about subscriptions, where I go online, etc, and I cannot think of anything I may hav done for several months to cause this sudden flood of scam. phish mail. \n\nGenerally the emails come in the form of some kind of advertisement from a legitimate company, but from an obviously shady address, with maybe an image of some kind of deal, followed by ridiculous amounts of random information, bits of other emails to other people, bits of weird things like business newsletters, legal and technical jargon from who knows where about who knows what, broken up by what looks sometimes like html code.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe latest one I got was an Easter ad image from Costco (from [info\\_iCF5sQvYxe@hastjyelkmydbga.m.gbhem](mailto:info_iCF5sQvYxe@hastjyelkmydbga.m.gbhem.org).org and CC'd to several other's, like [1.2.3.4.jjga@aol.com](mailto:1.2.3.4.jjga@aol.com)), followed by a stream of hundreds of lines of random shit like broken info about differentN.  American university newsletters from department heads, then a bunch of bs in French, and then hundreds of sets of numbers and letters, all in the same form.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy questions are these: is there a way to combat these within gmail, like marking each one as spam, or junk or what? With newsletter emails from obviously legit companies, I would simply unsubscribe, but from these scam emails, the Unsubscribe option always brings me to a suspicious webpage and asks I enter. my email address, which of course I do not do.\n\nAnd also, does anyone have any idea what I might have done to have started this barrage of bullshit? I do not recall irresponsibly giving my email address out in any way whatsoever that I can think of, to legit sources or not, none at all, for many months.I haven't signed up for anything lately, online or at a store, I haven't subscribed to any weird websites, etc. So what gives?

I was very tired and stupid at the time and I fell for it, filling out my discord login information in a login page that redirected me to the official discord moderator exam website.\n\nI was suspicious at first when the login verification email sent me a different IP address and location and so I decided to check from my phone. It showed the same IP address. Now I was using a mobile data provider for both devices so I thought that it was related to where the mobile data was hosted and thought nothing of it.\n\nI know this was very stupid of me but I verified the login and immediately after I verified it I got logged out from my discord account in all of my devices. I panicked and tried to reset the password (somehow the email was still the same) but I couldn\u2019t because the hacker set up their own 2FA that I couldn\u2019t bypass. At this point I assumed my account was gone for good so I wrote a support email to discord to delete my account.\n\nNow I assume the account has none of my personal information. The email I used wasn\u2019t a personal one, I don\u2019t have my phone number linked to it, and I didn\u2019t have any credit card information in it since I am still a kid (I had nitro but it was gifted to me by a friend and it was expiring in 4 days as of writing this). I also changed all my passwords on other websites/games just to make sure.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t know why but somehow the hacker bought discord boosts through my account. I don\u2019t know where they charged it or how they were able to buy it but the badge is there on my profile (I was able to see my profile through a friend\u2019s screenshot).\n\nI am currently panicking and I am very scared. I don\u2019t want my personal info (such as IP address, address, face, etc.) being leaked by whoever hacked my account. \n\nSo yeah don\u2019t fall for this.",

        "selftext": "I received this email back in late December but I didn't really open until a few days ago since I was cleaning out my inbox and spam folders (which was where I found it). After reading the email I was honestly quite anxious, despite the fact that both my mom and my boyfriend (who I showed this email to) reassured me that it was a scam and I should just ignore it. \n\nAlthough it's been four days without me hearing anything from my relatives and friends about some inappropriate videos of me plus the fact that I have seen a similar email on the internet, I still feel pretty anxious because of the last part of the email (shown in the second screenshot). \n\nAnyway, other than providing me reassurance and soothing my anxiety about this, please let me know if there are any places where I can report these types of emails! And let me know if you had similar experiences. (Also is it even possible to download Trojans/any sort of virus on the MacOS/iOS/the operating systems that Apple uses since these are my primary devices?)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/viq2fdonpgd81.jpg?width=2390&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3db850f9a79177f210c6c0a02009e250c409b875\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1edxydonpgd81.jpg?width=2398&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9a468b43312495173b1abcaf136e619b3727695",

I tried changing my password only for it to say \"hindi puwedeng mag lagay ng blanko sa dulo ng mga letra\" which made me confuse even more and did a google translate.\n\nAfter that i checked and typed again but it wouldn't work,  i didn't even put any spaces.. At this point i felt a sudden rush of being scared hit me,  i copy and pasted the link to totalvirus and found out that its a phishing link.\n\nNow i tried to change my password only for it to say \"incorrect password\" at this point i tried to do it by using my connected phone number to get a code,  only for me to be sent 2 codes with the same number which made me even more suspicious and scared.\n\nI couldn't unlink my gmail recovery and my phone number from that account since my password wouldn't work,  so i instead deleted my google account and tried refreshing my computer after it.  \n\nPlease im so scared what do i do now? I need advice i need help!",

I searched \"accounts.google.com\" alone through and see the same thing you got, some unknown AV vendor CMC Intell flagging it- and no one else. In which case I wouldn't take at face value. \n\nCould there perhaps be some hidden scripting in the url you clicked? Perhaps, but I can't see the url fully so I can't say one way or another. But it's also flagged the main domain like what I searched above so I'm thinking there's no rational reason for their flag to begin with.\n\nAs for using phone codes to reset the password- as long as you are directly on Google's recovery page, and working through their legitimate recovery means I don't see an issue- the multiple codes could just be a coincidence from you clicking too much.\n\nonce again, can't explain the language being changed in that recovery email- could easily be a Google problem, could just as easily be something you did and you didn't realize.",

You only need a username to be given in IG for the system to send a password reset email.\n\nThe other reason can be just bots spamming that password reset button to push me into changing my username so it gets open to be used by a new user.\n\n  \nIn all cases, setting up the two-step verification makes it impossible for others to gain access to my accounts. Personally find it the best to have an authenticator app, that is not tied via email to any of my other accounts and is standalone use for it.\n\nIf by some means another user gains access to my account, then it has been my own fault, because I have then given my password to a phishing form AND somehow leaked my authenticator app as well.",

The platform puts two and two together and just records that the user reported the email and that is that.\n\nIf the email was not a simulation, like this one, it will wind up in whatever predetermined inbox/distribution list you have set up. I would certainly investigate the email and determine if it was a phish. I would communicate to your user once you have rendered a verdict - if it is not a phish and in fact is an email the user may need, I would give it back to them. If it IS a phish, I would take basic steps such as blocking the domain, ensuring no other users received the phish, making sure if it was a credential harvesting URL that your employees did not give up creds, changing passwords, etc.. \n\nYou can utilize the site '[checkphish.ai](https://checkphish.ai)' for free if a URL if involved. It will render a verdict in seconds.\n\nPhishMe & PhishLabs also have pretty great 'email incident response' services where they serve as the SOC investigating the emails reported by your employees. Not cheap services but pretty powerful.",

They used my full name as a headline. They also attached a text document that I didn't open. I deleted the email after about 30 minutes.\n\nToday I changed my passwords, put tape over my webcame and renewed my VPN subscription. Not soon after I did the final thing (the VPN) my internet on both my phone and computer have stopped working but I keep getting different reasons as to why my computer won't connect. It keeps saying internet access is blocked or that it won't connect, but when I troubleshoot I get different reasons each time. I've unplugged my ethernet twice. The first time I was told it was a firewall issue, then a DNS issue, not it's because it's an ethernet problem. But my TV uses wifi and is working fine. Does this person really have access to my comp? Is a virus taking over my computer?",

The VPN protects your identity and changes your route to the internet, directing you through what you would hope is some anonymising service. Its this automagic wizardry that is probably confusing things. \n\nTurn off your vpn, reboot, test. If issue persists, run a scan using your system tools. Then try Windows network wizard under the networking section of the Settings app. If you\u2019re on a mac, go to system preferences, network and look for similar self repair options (can\u2019t remember what its called). If you\u2019re on Linux, find a subreddit or get a more basic user friendly operating system.",

While searching for a job, I've had a company called Canada International Staffing Corporation reach out to me with a job offer. Well, they didn't offer the job right away, but rather they asked if I was interested in the position of \"Online Service Manager\" and to send me resume into them. Naturally, I sent it as I'm currently looking for work and desperation was calling. A few days later I received an application with a full time salary of about 70k. In the same email they attached their website [https://cistaffing.ca/](https://cistaffing.ca/) and everything on it looked decent on the surface. However, when you search the staff images on google, they are just generic images of business men and women. I was wondering if anyone could do a little searching their selves to justify my claims. I will add all of their information below. Thanks everyone and BE CAREFUL.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Canada International Staffing Corporation  \nPhone: +1 289 806 1626  \nWebsite [https://cistaffing.ca](https://cistaffing.ca/)  \n7030 Woodbine Avenue, Markham,  \nOntario L3R 6G2, Canada",

This happened the same minute I entered my credentials into the form. \n\nDoes this mean that they did not download anything? I am thinking so because otherwise hackers do attempts, the MS login history will say it was done from an IMAP protocol and that it was a synchronization attempt. \n\nObviously I changed all my passwords, should I be more afraid or can I relax a little if they did not have  time to download all my emails?

        "selftext": "Hi everyone.\n\nLong shot here, but I'm willing to try anything. My cousin was recently scammed, and they were successful in getting the desired money. ***Here is all that I know:***\n\n* Cousin used a Google web browser to search for the log in to Amazon (yes, they're old and didn't grow up with computers).\n* They somehow found a spoofed webpage for Amazon, which had a URL of an IP Address which sourced back to a Cloud service (I have the IP address, which I can relay to people via DM).\n* They received an error message when attempting to log in, which included a phone number (the number is still active, if you feel it would be helpful, please let me know and I'll provide it to you in a DM).\n* They called the number, and the person who answered didn't give them any indication that they were an Amazon support agent. They called themself \"John.\" John guided my cousin through downloading GoToAssist, where they screen shared with them, had them delete their CC info from an actual Amazon log in website, and then sign into their bank account via the computer.\n* John then guided my cousin through sending a payment of $1,800 through Zelle (which is exactly how much they had in their bank account). My cousin sent two payments since Zelle only allows a max of $999 sent at one time. This payment was sent to two different email addresses (I have both and can also provide them via DM).\n* Immediately upon getting the second payment, John hung up.\n\n**What they did after realizing it was a scam:**\n\n* Went to their bank. All of the online banking has been frozen, and their debit and credit cards have been reissued.\n* They changed all of their passwords.\n* They ran a virus scanner on their computer.\n* The programs they were instructed to download were deleted.\n* Filed a police report.\n* Filed a report through the FBI.\n\n**What I've done:**\n\n* Spoken to reps at their bank, along with helping them file a fraud claim.\n   * The bank states that they'll reach out in 10 business days. They have to wait on the recipient's bank's determination to see if my cousin will be given their money back, which my cousin's bank would not guarantee.\n* Contacted Zelle. They told us to contact my cousin's bank.\n\nI realize the likelihood of the money being recovered is slim to none because there's that clause that states you should only be sending money to people you know before you send it. I was wondering if anyone knew of any helpful advice for speaking to customer service reps at my cousin's bank (the cousin will be on the line with me while this takes place, so they'll give consent), and any information into contacting Zelle. Really, any helpful information will be great.\n\nThanks in advance.",

People have been taken for a lot more without realizing it, but hopefully by reporting as much information as possible you can help prevent this from happening to someone else.",

I clicked the link and it took me to an authentic looking DHL site which asked for my credit card details so I put in random numbers to see what would happen (I genuinely don't know what I was thinking) and it took me to a different page, where I finally realized how shady this was and immediately closed the tab. I've since deleted all the cookies on chrome, reinstalled chrome, changed my email password, changed my bank password on my phone, and ran a scan on Malwarebytes which said I was clean.

Can any please share Best practices that Security team should follow to analyse Phishing emails reported by end users. \n\nFew years back, we used to follow the below steps to investigate Phishing emails:-\n\n1. Check the header of email to see sender id/domain info.\n\n2. See if embedded links/attachments are malicious by scanning through various websites such as VirusTotal, McAfee, Symantec, Sucuri\n\n3. Check URL category of embedded url at Bluecoat, Websence, McAfee etc. \n\n4. Check the reputation of IP address, if available in email body. \n\nIf the email is malicious based on the above analysis then check how many such emails are delivered to other employees -  by searching the emails from same sender or emails with similar subject. Accordingly take actions- block sender/domain etc. I think at that time it was not possible for us to delete the emails that have already been delivered to users.\n\nCan somebody advise current practices. I have heard that we shouldn't scan files at VirusTotal - but I didn't completely understand the logic behind it. Are there any tools/websites that can be utilised for the same ?",

        "selftext": "Hey guys, I typically am pretty good about my online privacy, but today while going through my email accounts and clearing my inboxes, spam,  etc. I found a spam email that said, \"Hey, \\*MyRealName\\*. I just wanted  to let you know I'm near \\*MyRealCity\\*!\"\n\nNormally I wouldn't think much of receiving something like this on my work email or an email I use to sign up for social media, but this is from a Yahoo account that I created a couple years back that was only used for a couple anonymous throwaway accounts here and there. I'm feeling uneasy now.\n\nI ran my email through haveibeenpwned and there were no results. I never signed up for anything  using my real name. The only thing I had connected was my backup phone  number in case I forgot my password. I know this obviously isn't the  best practice, but I figured my phone number alone would protect me from things like this. I also use Firefox with all the recommended privacy  add-ons, never stay logged into my email, and never gave it out  directly.\n\nAs an individual who was stalked and harassed for years and commonly received threats and  blackmail from my stalker through email, I'm on edge right now. I  thought I was being safe, but now I'm wondering where I'm going wrong.\n\nAny suggestions as to how they may have gotten my real name and location so I can prevent this from happening again?",

Users in our environment have been getting e-mails that are very simple, they contain a link to a random article on some reputable site or at least semi-reputable. There is no specific URL trickery or anything like that. Are the phishers just trying to test if the inbox exists? The sender varies from gmail/Hotmail type email to professional e-mail accounts.

If your filtering allows it, it may be a good idea to get some reports on it for a period of time before outright blocking them.\n\nOne of the things I've noticed is that most of them are from Gmail addresses where there is a name, often last name followed by initials, then numbers or sometimes name and numbers followed by another name and numbers.  Some of the Subject lines start with \"Risk \\&amp; Repeat:\".  They also seem to focus on our users whose email addresses start with certain letters; currently, most of the targeted email addresses start with K through N and Z.",

Also simple things like inconsistent text alignment. It has a number to call \u201cif I have questions about this *offer*\u201d. Thought that was weird language to use. I\u2019ve googled the number and the search results return many reports of people claiming it\u2019s a complete scam. I\u2019ve also googled the P.O. Box where I can mail the money to and it\u2019s a random box not associated with any business in a family suburb in a city in my country that I don\u2019t live anywhere near.\n\nAlthough my nerves were calmed hearing other people have had a similar issue I decided to get a credit report from Equifax. I received the credit report from them and to my surprise this debt showed up on the report. The account had been opened in Feb 2019 and closed in Aug 2019. Non of this to my knowledge. I called Equifax and they claim that this hasn\u2019t or won\u2019t affect my credit score.\n\nI\u2019ve had the same bank, credit cards and debts all with one bank since I was in college over 8 years ago. The day before my credit report came in, I received another duplicate letter claiming I owe the same amount form the same sender.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if this is the correct subreddit for a question like this, or if anyone can provide an insights, direction or guidance but I\u2019d figured I\u2019d try. Was my data bought, sold or stolen without my knowledge? \n\nI can provide more specific details if this will help with answers.\n\nThank you.",

It so bad I've heard most lenders will automatically ignore one bad mark.\n\nThere are \\[at least\\] two possibilities here:\n\n1. Identity theft was used to open the credit card account. Freezing your credit reports will help with this. For the US, it is free, but be sure to do all 3 bureaus.\n2. Some scammers got creative. Send some bogus info to a credit bureau, then offer to remove/correct it for a price.\n\nAs for your question, \"Was my data bought, sold or stolen without my knowledge?\" - Yes. Any data point you share with a company will in all likelihood eventually be hacked, lost, leaked, stolen or sold \u2014 usually through no fault of your own. And if you\u2019re an American, it means (at least for the time being) your recourse to do anything about that when it does happen is limited or nil.",

I'm not worried about his threats, I don't believe them (for example, I use a desktop so I don't have a webcam or microphone) but I am concerned about what info they might have access to, e.g. other passwords & accounts.\n\nHas anyone come across this scam before?

I'm assuming it might be a keylogger due to the inaccuracy in the password.\n\nAlso, could they have accessed my phone instead of my pc?",

The details on those domains are different to [experian.com](https://experian.com).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI sent an email to [experian.com](https://experian.com) asking whether the domains are legit. Unlikely I'll hear back, but treat it as very suspicious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Both sites pose as an identify theft protection service and what better way to steal your identity than posing as something that needs to know everything about you to \"protect\" you. I sent it onto Microsoft as well to confirm legitimacy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit2: Hmm.. so that's interesting. Just had a response back from Microsoft saying the email is in fact authentic.

You're right! \nBut the fact is that when you change the password, my trojan always saves a new one!\n\nI've been watching you for a few months now.\nThe fact is that you were infected with malware through an adult site that you visited.\n\nIf you are not familiar with this, I will explain.\nTrojan Virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other device.\nThis means that I can see everything on your screen, turn on the camera and microphone, but you do not know about it.\n\nI also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.\n\nWhy your antivirus did not detect malware?\nAnswer: My malware uses the driver, I update its signatures every 4 hours so that your antivirus is silent.\n\nI made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of the screen, and in the right half you see the video that you watched.\nWith one click of the mouse, I can send this video to all your emails and contacts on social networks. I can also post access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.\n\nIf you want to prevent this, transfer the amount of $758 to my bitcoin address (if you do not know how to do this, write to Google: &#8220;Buy Bitcoin&#8221;).\n\nMy bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: 17zmnmqEUCesNz6UgXGbRk7fKnu8iq1q2J\n\nAfter receiving the payment, I will delete the video and you will never hear me again.\nI give you 48 hours to pay.\nI have a notice reading this letter, and the timer will work when you see this letter.\n\nFiling a complaint somewhere does not make sense because this email cannot be tracked like my bitcoin address.\nI do not make any mistakes.\n\nIf I find that you have shared this message with someone else, the video will be immediately distributed.\n\nBest wishes!",

While you were viewing video clips, your browser initiated operating as a Remote control Desktop that has a keylogger which provided me accessibility to your screen and also cam. Immediately after that, my software obtained all your contacts from your Messenger, FB, as well as e-mailaccount. And then I created a double video. First part displays the video you were watching (you have a fine taste hehe), and 2nd part displays the view of your web cam, yeah its you.\n\nYou actually have just two solutions. Lets review each one of these choices in details:\n\nFirst option is to neglect this e mail. Consequently, I am going to send your actual tape to every bit of your contacts and thus visualize concerning the embarrassment you experience. Or if you happen to be in a loving relationship, how it will affect?\n\n2nd choice would be to compensate me $946. We will regard it as a donation. Then, I will instantly delete your video recording. You can continue your lif e like this never took place and you would never hear back again from me.\n\nYou'll make the payment by Bitcoin (if you don't know this, search \"how to buy bitcoin\" in Google).\n\nBTC Address to send to: 1L9bZMzajNeZQvDmSMhm7jcjgG9S5FihLg\\[CASE sensitive copy & paste it\\]\n\nIf you have been thinking about going to the authorities, look, this email message can not be traced back to me. I have taken care of my moves. I am also not attempting to ask you for money a lot, I simply prefer to be paid for.\n\nYou have one day in order to make the payment. I've a specific pixel in this e-mail, and at this moment I know that you have read through this e mail. If I don't get the BitCoins, I will send your video recording to all of your contacts including family members, coworkers, and so on. Nevertheless, if I receive the payment, I will erase the recording immediately. If you want proof, reply with Yes! then I will certainly send out your video to your 9 contacts. This is the nonnegotiable offer, thus please do not waste mine time & yours by responding to this mail.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;",

There's a PDF attached, the file name is literally just my name. \n\nIn the past week I've also been receiving text messages from PhiloTV (saying please tap the link to sigjnin), some sort of streaming platform that I made an account for and deleted back in 2021, so I'm not sure if that's related or just a total coincidence.\n\nIs there a safe way to view the contents of the PDF? If I use the GMail app on my iPhone is that completely idiotic?",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone\n\nI recieved a suspicious email today and i'm honestly scared bc i dont want anything of my private stuff leaked. Can anyone tell if this is real and if so what i should do? I also dont know how they could send it to me with my own email adress.\n\nHeres the mail:\n\nHello pervert,\n\nI want to inform you about a very bad situation for you. However, you can benefit from it, if you will act wisely.\n\nHave you heard of Pegasus? This is a spyware program that installs on computers and smartphones and allows hackers to monitor the activity of device owners. It provides access to your webcam, messengers, emails, call records, etc. It works well on Android, iOS, and Windows. I guess, you already figured out where I\u2019m getting at.\n\nIt\u2019s been a few months since I installed it on all your devices because you were not quite choosy about what links to click on the internet. During this period, I\u2019ve learned about all aspects of your private life, but one is of special significance to me.\n\nI\u2019ve recorded many videos of you jerking off to highly controversial porn videos. Given that the \u201cquestionable\u201d genre is almost always the same, I can conclude that you have sick perversion.\n\nI doubt you\u2019d want your friends, family and co-workers to know about it. However, I can do it in a few clicks.\n\nEvery number in your contact book will suddenly receive these videos \u2013 on WhatsApp, on Telegram, on Skype, on email \u2013 everywhere. It is going to be a tsunami that will sweep away everything in its path, and first of all, your former life.\n\nDon\u2019t think of yourself as an innocent victim. No one knows where your perversion might lead in the future, so consider this a kind of deserved punishment to stop you.\nBetter late than never.\n\nI\u2019m some kind of God who sees everything. However, don\u2019t panic. As we know, God is merciful and forgiving, and so do I. But my mercy is not free.\n\nTransfer $922 USD to my bitcoin wallet: bc1q59k0t3ynwcjw676cuceq6p0z3kmpw2q36n8k6l\n\nOnce I receive confirmation of the transaction, I will permanently delete all videos compromising you, uninstall Pegasus from all of your devices, and disappear from your life. You can be sure \u2013 my benefit is only money. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t be writing to you, but destroy your life without a word in a second.\n\nI\u2019ll be notified when you open my email, and from that moment you have exactly 48 hours to send the money. If cryptocurrencies are unchartered waters for you, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s very simple. Just google \u201ccrypto exchange\u201d and then it will be no harder than buying some useless stuff on Amazon.\n\nI strongly warn you against the following:\n\n) Do not contact the police. I have access to all your devices, and as soon as I find out you ran to the cops, videos will be published.\n) Don\u2019t try to reset or destroy your devices.\n\nAs I mentioned above: I\u2019m monitoring all your activity, so you either agree to my terms or the videos are published.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t forget that cryptocurrencies are anonymous, so it\u2019s impossible to identify me using the provided address.\nGood luck, my perverted friend. I hope this is the last time we hear from each other.\n\nAnd some friendly advice: from now on, don\u2019t be so careless about your online security.",

He says my name, surname, address and the numbers on the Revolut card. I said no, he erased the payment and i check that my account was restricted. He says \"i'm unlocking it now, please do a recharge so we can verify it's all ok\", and i stupidly listened him. I recharge 1k (he says \"do 300\u20ac, 500\u20ac, at least two times\", and... byebye. 5 transactions to \"ZEN\". Revolut says \"no, we won't get money back\". I think i've 0% possibility to see my money back. So, only for next generations.\n\nI feel so stupid.",

It's a good practice to never respond to such texts, as it can confirm to the scammer that your number is active.

        "selftext": "Hello guys,\n\nI\u00b4m a little in panic right now, since I am always super cautious when it comes to emails.\n\nToday I have received the following email from Paypal:\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nDate: Wednesday 15 March 2024,  09:40 CEST\n\n**Address**: \"[donotreply@paypal.com](mailto:donotreply@paypal.com)\" (without quotation marks ofc)\n\n**Subject**: Here are the transaction fees you pay\n\n**Content**:\n\nHello, **first name**\n\nThese are the fees you have paid\n\nYou have closed your Paypal account. Below you will find an overview of the transaction fees you have paid in the past year.\n\nThe attached list of fees in PDF format contains the relevant details.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nWelp, as stupid as I am and since everything was completely the same (signature, copyright, legal notic,etc) as in other PayPal emails, I opened the PDF in my Outlook app on the iPhone and saw there\u00b4s only a summary of 0\u20ac fees (PDF seemed authentic), and after that I clicked on the link \"Contact\" (Yep, stupid, I know). However, I never signed in through the website and immediately closed the tab in Safari and deleted everything in my history.\n\nI immediately contacted PayPal Customer Service on my pc and voiced my worries.\n\nThey wrote the following message before I uploaded the screenshots they demanded:\n\n\"According to the details I see on your PayPal account, the last email I see in your PayPal account notification centre was on 15 May 2024, **09:30 CEST** with subject line - \"**Here are the transaction fees you specified**\". No other email has been sent to you in the last 5 days with the subject you specified.\"\n\nFirst I was relieved, but then my scepticism began to grow again because of the different time and subject, especially after I have uploaded the screenshots of the email since the customer support wrote then:\n\n\"Thank you for bringing this email to our attention. If you receive this type of email in the future, please forward the original email to [phishing@paypal.com](mailto:phishing@paypal.com). Once you have forwarded the email to us, please delete it from your inbox.\n\nIf you have provided financial or password information in response to a suspicious email or on a website, report it to your bank immediately and change your password and security questions in your PayPal account.\n\nI can also confirm that your PayPal account is active and that there are no problems with your PayPal account.\"\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI copied the link I clicked and ran it through both VirusTotal and Urlvoid and it came out as clear and under the same IP as the normal PayPal address. I also copied the email address and ran it through foresaid sites and a cyrillic decoder (came out as clear as well).\n\nSo now I am rather confused:\n\n* Can the pdf hijack iOS by simply opening it? And if so, should I reset my iOS?\n* Was this now a legit email from PayPal and was there only a delay in receiving the email and a translation error perhaps through customer support?\n\nThanks in advance for your help!\n\nEdit: Please keep in mind that I also had to translate everything from German to English and instead of first name, it was indeed my first name",

Right away I could tell that it was a scam because you can't open a bank account with out verifying details AND send/request Zelle payments since you need to verify that info with Zelle. I went along with it anyway for the details. *I saw another post almost verbatim but using \"Citi Bank\" as the bank*. \n\nThe gist was:\n\nSomeone opened a chase bank account with my details by the name of \"Shawn Foster\" from Cleveland, Ohio. He allegedly opened an account and immediately tried sending 2 Zelle transactions under my name. The first transaction for $999.00 & 2nd for $989.55. They were going to go a head and cancel these, gave me 2 phony cancellation numbers and another number to call; 844-645-8554 - he said to call immediately after and give them the cancellation numbers. Even went as far as to say they'd report this to the police and I'd get information on the investigation. Rubbish.\n\nBe Safe People!\n\n",

        "selftext": "Hey there. Have a question from a concerned family member I was hoping to get a bit of expertise with. Is 1-855-716-5080 a legit Apple customer support number? Long story short, they were surfing the web, pop up \u201cpopped up\u201d and \u201clocked their computer.\u201d They searched using their phones and stumbled on this number. I am not totally sure if this number was provided on the pop up or if they actually googled and got this number, however, my search for Apple customer care does not give this number. What transpired next was a series of calls, that originated with this number, but included call backs from 949-771-7258 and 512-884-5022 all claiming to be from Apple support. Basic google searches for all 3 numbers return nothing affiliated with Apple support at all.\n\nAs I\u2019m listening to the story, more red flags came up. The customer service tech at some point asked them to download an app for remote access and also to check bank accounts not using the computer, but their phone. Also, at some point the rep told them not to alert the bank quite yet or use the internet from their computer. Supposedly nothing has been withdrawn or looked suspicious yet.\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions on next steps, I would appreciate it, but it\u2019s sounding like they might be in need of a complete hard drive wipe, new Apple ID logins and definitely should be alerting financial institutions at the minimum. Thanks!",

I'm not an Apple expert, but hopefully others can help from here.",

However, as of now, we have not received a satisfactory response or resolution from their support team.\n\nBased on this experience, it appears that Wild West Domains may not have adequate measures in place to prevent abuse and respond promptly to legitimate abuse reports. Their support team seems ill-prepared to handle such cases, potentially allowing malicious actors to exploit their services for nefarious purposes.\n\nWhile we continue to pursue the matter with Wild West Domains, we wanted to share this information with our colleagues in the security community.

For example... Your passwd on the hack moment: troleadaportrolearmeamixd  \n\n\nThis alone wouldn't be a problem if only I wasn't particularly interested in your love of the very controversial genre of pornography.  \nYou know what I mean. I saved a backup copy of your webcam and screen recordings as you enjoy jerking off to these videos.  \nThe video on the left shows a recording of your screen with the clip, while the one on the right shows you in real time.  \n\n\nThere is no need to feel sorry for yourself or blame me for the situation - the fault here is yours alone because if you gaze into a dark abyss for too long,  \nthis darkness eventually will come knocking at your door.  \nYou should even be grateful to fate that I'm the only one who discovered your unhealthy obsession and not your friends, family and colleagues.  \n\n\nAnd this is where I get to the essence of my message - I can easily organize this. Everyone you know, love and cherish,  \neveryone you've spent years building your reputation as a respectable and honorable person in front of,  \nwill get a copy of the video of you self-pleasing yourself while watching these controversial videos.  \n\n\nAll of your email and messengers contacts will get these videos at the same time.  \nYou will have nothing left but to move to another city, and perhaps even another country, to get rid of the sick guy trail that will be running behind you.  \nHowever, this also might not help. As they say, the Internet remembers everything.  \nThere's a good chance you will have to deal with the consequences for the rest of your life, despite your efforts to clear your name.  \n\n\nNow, as I promised, the good news.  \nI have a win-win solution for both you and me.  \nYou regain your old free life and I make a small profit.  \n\n\nYou should transfer $1490 to my Bitcoin wallet: 1JmAEwSa4xHxQTVEChaF9Gs7cSNZVQMx22  \n\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with cryptocurrency, it's simple.  \nType \"crypto exchange\" into the search engine and choose the option that suits you.  \nYou can think of me as a kind of your life coach because if I didn't show up in your life,  \nyou would continue to lead the same destructive lifestyle as before.  \nSo I kind of did you a favor, and favors are never free.  \n\n\nI must warn you not to do something stupid that you might do due to your lack of experience, such as:  \n& Contacting law enforcement.  \n\u00a0I'm untraceable anyway, because cryptocurrencies are anonymous and I have access to all your devices,  \n\u00a0so as soon as I notice you trying to do something like this, the compromising clips will be made public.  \n& Negotiating with me by responding to this letter. My demands are ultimatums.  \n\u00a0I generated this letter using your own email client, therefore it is impossible to contact me!  \n& Resetting, reinstalling your system or destroying your devices won't help you.  \n\u00a0I repeat: I have access to them and if I notice such activity, hasta la vista, baby.  \n\n\nI wish you all the best and especially get rid of your \"interesting\" habits.  \nThen you will not only no longer encounter people like me, but you will also be able to reach a new quality level in your self-development.  \n\n\nBye!  \n\n\nP.S. A little friendly advice: from now on, take what you do online more seriously.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uh22zcrpy8oc1.png?width=423&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8924fb533a4baa5bc0f1e541c58ad5d5ec991f1\n\n ",

The things that came over my head:\n\nFirst, appart from changing the password, you can download an antivirus and scan your device. \n\nSecond. Check the sent emails, so you can see if they have been using it, between other things, to send spam to other people. Also check the activity in social media if he has it. You can also see if they created services or social media accounts, or if they subscribed you to some things in the inbox. You can try to access the accounts or change passwords and then delete them or unsubscribe to the services. \n\nThird. I don't know where are you from. But if your country has some kind of electronic ID (or something like that) please go check if he has a copy in services like Google Drive, OneDrive or Dropbox that could be leaked. In that case, take it down and make a new one, so they cannot inpersonate him online. \n\nAlso check that there are no photos of him or someone else there or in any social media (in case that he has) linked to his email address. If that's the case you can always use the google image search tool to see quickly if it's being used for some other purposes. If that is the case, you can try to report it in the sites, so they will take whatever down.\n\nIf it has been used for bad purposes, or you suspect that, you can do what I said, and also contact with the proper cybersecurity organisation or institution (or even the police) to explain your case with all the details and data that you can, and try to do something about it. They will help you better to solve it. And they have enough authority to solve this themselves if needed.\n\nPlease tell us how it goes. I wish you the best. Also if you have some questions or concerns about what I said, you can reply me and I'll try to help :)",

        "title": "Reporting phishing website in Godaddy is impossible",
        "selftext": "I am a college student in Chicago, and I need your help and advice. A month ago, I encountered a **phishing website that was registered with Godaddy**. The website looked like a legitimate online store, but it was actually a scam that tried to steal my credit card information. Luckily, I realized it was a phishing website before I entered any sensitive information, and I decided to report it to Godaddy and other authorities.\n\nOn 18 December, 2023, I **reported the phishing website to Godaddy** via [abuse@godaddy.com](mailto:abuse@godaddy.com) and their [https://supportcenter.godaddy.com/abusereport](https://supportcenter.godaddy.com/abusereport). I provided them with the URL of the phishing website, a screenshot of the website, and an explanation of why it was a phishing website. Godaddy responded that they will handle this and take down the website as soon as possible. They also thanked me for reporting it and asked me to report any other suspicious websites to their email address.\n\nHowever, three weeks passed, and nothing happened. The phishing website was still online and active. I checked the WHOIS information of the website, and it was still registered with Godaddy. I contacted Godaddy again, and they gave me the same response as before. They said they will take down the website, but they did not give me any timeline or confirmation.I was very angry and frustrated, so I decided to report the phishing website to other authorities as well. I reported it to the **Better Business Bureau (BBB)** and the **Federal Trade Commission (FTC)** via their [https://www.bbb.org/file-a-complaint](https://www.bbb.org/file-a-complaint) & [https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/#/?orgcode=USAGOV](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/#/?orgcode=USAGOV). I also provided them with the same information and evidence as I did to Godaddy. \n\nI hoped that they would take some action and pressure Godaddy to take down the website.However, another week passed, and nothing changed. The phishing website was still online and active. I checked the status of my reports on BBB and FTC, and they said they were still processing them. They did not give me any updates or feedback. I contacted them again, and they told me to wait patiently and to report any other phishing websites to their email addresses or websites.I felt like I was **stuck in a loop** that I could not get out of. \n\nI reported a phishing website to Godaddy, BBB, and FTC, but they did nothing to take it down. They just thanked me for reporting it and asked me to report more. They did not seem to care about the harm and damage that the phishing website could cause to other people. They did not seem to take phishing websites seriously.I am very disappointed and angry with Godaddy, BBB, and FTC. They have failed to protect me and other internet users from phishing websites. **They have failed to fulfill their responsibilities and obligations.** They have failed to do their jobs.That is why I decided to post my story here on Reddit. \n\nI want to let more people know the inaction of Godaddy, BBB, and FTC. I want to warn more people not to fall and not to trust Godaddy, BBB, and FTC. I want to expose their incompetence and negligence.\n\n**I think my experience gonna help you to report others. And I also need your help and advice.** Please share your thoughts about **reporting Godaddy** with me. I appreciate any feedback and support. Thank you for reading my post and for your help.",

You did mention you cleared all website data from your browser, so there's a step. Unfortunately, I am not a mac user, so neither do I know what utilities are available nor do I know where to look when traversing through Apple's file system. As long as you did not download or open upon having downloaded the PDF file, then everything may be fine. But personally I would still be vigilant.",

Unless it\u2019s handwritten on exactly as we told (the RR\u2019s, the duplicate street name and numbers in the same town with the same postal code are horrendous-and yea, for years many of including council men affected have been trying to get our stupid municipalities or postal services to change this). Then there\u2019s packages addressed to for example Fred Flinstone RR3 Stoneville ON NXP 1X8  \u2026 RR3 is only for the letter mail. If a courier tries to deliver it, it\u2019s non deliverable because there\u2019s no road name and 911# (the numbers the rural houses are assigned now). RR3 is a combination of roads and houses. So maybe a courier that normally goes there would recognize the name, but a new one or a substitute or maybe someone that doesn\u2019t get packages normally\u2026no one knows.\nSo we have packages that go nowhere.\nSo this text sounds very legit to some of us in Canada. I came here to check and saw this. Tons of people are going to fall for it here. Lots of elderly. Stop putting down the victims and instead start telling others about it!!! There\u2019s always a new scam, or old one recycling. Always the same few cultures or whatever you want to call them doing it.",

        "selftext": "I wanted to share a recent phishing scam or social engineering attack that seems to be making the rounds. Let's break down its possible components and discuss how we can protect ourselves from falling victim to such schemes.\n\n1. **Random subject lines and numbers:** Scammers are getting smarter and using random subject lines to avoid spam filters and catch our attention. Be careful when encountering unusual subject lines, especially if they contain random numbers or characters.\n2. **Random content and mass emailing:** The email's content may appear to be gibberish or include random numbers, making it harder for spam filters to identify. Additionally, scammers often send these emails to numerous recipients, increasing the odds of finding unsuspecting victims.\n3. **Suspicious Attachment:** One red flag to watch out for is an attachment file (calendar or html file). Scammers could attempt to trick you into downloading and opening a malicious file that could lead to severe consequences.\n\n# This attack could involve phishing or malware distribution.\n\n1. **Phishing:** If you click on a link within the attachment or reply to email, you might end up on a fake website that looks remarkably similar to legitimate service. The attacker's goal is to steal your login credentials or personal information.\n2. **Malware distribution:** Opening the attachment file could activate malware that might compromise your device, steal sensitive data, or cause other harm.\n\n# Tips for Protecting Yourself:\n\n1. **Avoid clicking suspicious links and downloading attachments:** If you're unsure about the sender's legitimacy or the email. Legitimate organization won't ask you provide sensitive data through email.\n2. **Guard your personal information:** Be cautious about sharing personal information, login credentials, or financial details via email. Legitimate organization won't ask you to provide sensitive data through email.\n3. **Report suspicious emails:** If you come across a suspicious email, consider reporting it to your email provider. Reporting such incidents helps others from failing into the same trap.\n4. **Immediate deletion:** If you receive an email that raises suspicious, don't hesitate to delete it immediately. Move it to the trash permanently.\n\nPhishing and malware attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, but with the right knowledge and caution, we can protect ourselves and from falling prey to these scams.\n\nLet's keep each other safe online!!!\n\n# UPVOTE to spread it out to let more people attention about this.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zvjr1mse8adb1.png?width=656&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cabd54bae7104df24dafb215c372e6889b7975d",

It's essential to take extra precautions to protect our personal information online. Using dedicated email addresses and phone numbers for different purposes is a smart approach to enhance security. It minimizes the risk of potential data breaches and keeps our sensitive information safe. It's unfortunate that social media accounts seem to experience data breaches more frequently, but being proactive with separate, private contact details can provide an added layer of defense against potential threats. Stay vigilant, and thanks for sharing these valuable insights! \ud83d\udc4d",

        "selftext": "Good day, all. I am curious regarding your opinions on poisoning the \"phishing\" well. That is, what are your thoughts on flooding a phishing attempt with fake, though believable, information. For example, taking a Google Form phishing for login credentials and flooding it with thousands of credentials that won't work. \n\nAlmost like what has been described in this article ([https://www.cosive.com/blog/canarycredentialsintro](https://www.cosive.com/blog/canarycredentialsintro)), but with less emphasis on making accounts that the phisher will want to use. That is, focusing less on creation of real accounts that signal a breach, and more focus on submitting so many fake account credentials that it becomes impossible for the phisher to distinguish between real and fake accounts.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Would it work? Would this help obfuscate real credentials of real users? Or would this just be a waste of time for the person deploying the poison? Thanks in advance.",

The page was still loading (entire page was white) when I closed it. \n\nGoing into that profile, i noticed more posts resembling the one I clicked and scrolling deep in the comments I saw people say that this profile had been hacked. \n\nI saw other people comment how \u201ccute\u201d the pictures are. On my end nothing loaded.\n\nShould I be concerned? I was on my iPhone 14 Pro Max running latest iOS 16.5.\n\nHopefully someone has more knowledge on this than me. Thanks in advance!",

Randomly my phone scrolled by its self, and i noticed some slight screwy things in my inbox. My ex was very resourceful and has a lot of money which makes the accessibility easier. At some point, I even went to the Apple Store and they told me my phone wasn\u2019t compromised however after talking to them my feeling is that they detect common breaches not Phising Hackers because when i was asking question multiple people weren\u2019t even aware of the technology. DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW TO DETECT IF MY PHONE IS STILL PHISHED OR EVER HAS BEEN?? I got a new phone however I\u2019m still under paranoid. Eventually i will learn the technic myself to become more educated. Any suggestions, advice, info\u2026.",

If you had any doubts about it, you could always go to www.paypal.com and log into your account if you still have one to confirm any transactions.\n\n> The $ amounts keep growing.\n\nWell, you know it's phishing, so seems like you're still putting thought into this.\n\n> I went on the web site and sent copies of emails to Phishing support each time I get one. I have never got a response back yet from them.\n\nWhat website? PayPal? Okay, that's good. They can't stop those emails, because the emails aren't coming from PayPal and they aren't even spoofing PayPal. You don't provide the email addresses of the senders, but they're usually free email services or compromised accounts even from universities. Assuming you contacted PayPal, there's nothing of value they can respond to you with other than \"good job!\".\n\n> I try to sign into our old account to maybe look at things and it has error \"problem on their end\" over and over different days.\n\nYour old PayPal account? Don't quote error messages, screenshot them. No one is going to guess the context of the error you quoted.\n\n\n> I dont think paypal is linked to any of our current accounts, however it is starting to concern me because of the number of emails.\n\nDo you have access to your actual banking accounts? You should be easily able to check that no money is being used.\n\n> I'm not sure what kind of sneaky underhanded tricks these rip off artist can perform these days. \n\nIt's called lying. They're not very good because they don't need to be. It costs them nothing to send and it makes them some amount of money that goes a long way in third world countries.\n\n> Does someone have ideas/help as to anything else I might can try?\n\nYou just keep ignoring them. Create a rule in your email that deletes any emails with the subject line. Your email address is out there. There's no putting the cat back in the bag. If you're seeing these emails, you have a really terrible email service because even Gmail filters these out automatically.",

You now have to right click on the email and view the message source. It takes a little bit of scrolling but you will find the geeksquad email as the sender. Since their email is no longer viewable when hovering I'm asuming that that is part of the reason why adding their email to blocked contacts will no longer block them. adding key wods to filter them out will not work either as they change their headers all the time. Like other users say, a lot of the time the message body is one big picture, so email filters cannot catch that as well. It gets so insidious, that they even put your own email upto the @ part in the From part.",

I could tell this because of the formatting of these emails and the fact that they used the exact same method to get through the spam filter\n\nAt this point they feel targeted. I am not important, nor do i have any accounts that are worth targeting me specifically to steal. However recently i have been getting spam emails from literal randomly generated emails with my name which is in my email in them with not even links in them with no real correlation to their message. Like look at this:  [https://imgur.com/4zqLqkU](https://imgur.com/4zqLqkU) . The first black box is where the name in my email is. Like what is this?? I get 3 of these a day from different emails all with my name in the middle like that.\n\nMy question would be: is this specifically targeted at me and how do i block these emails out of my main inbox?",

Of course the sender could had been faked. But the links are legit, then what's the scam?

This is something I can't really comprehend, how this messages ended up in my inbox and not theirs. The second strangeness, as you can see at the bottom that somebody (can....@hotmail.com) sent a followup email, telling both paypal and the supposed receipient to get lost; and this message, again landed in my inbox.

So the adversary is either testing the strength of the Spam filter OR they know their target has a weak Spam filtering.\n\nThe reason I suggest this is a \u201ctest\u201d is that there is no payload in the email. \n\nAnother metric that they phish for is whether you are the sort of person who is curious and opens every email is the use of Web Beacons. This makes you a great target for a real phishing email. \n\nAdditionally, you are a candidate for being targeted with future phishing or scam campaigns if you reply to the email. I see people reply to this stuff ALL THE TIME because they do not recognize  it to be malicious. \n\nWhy do they do this? Why not just send 5000 emails and hope you get lucky? Several reasons. \n\n1. If you are using email marketing to make your phishing email look more legit, then it costs money to send. You don\u2019t want to send unless you have a higher chance of getting compensated. \n\n2. Sending too many Spam or phishing emails out at once, and to the wrong people, can get your MX domain put on a list. \n\n3. The sender in this case might actually be a broker. A broker will take data breach dumps with email addresses and narrow it down to only those users who are likely to engage. This type of list can then be sold. \n\nIf the last bullet is true, with this type of technique and no payload, then it doesn\u2019t matter if the sender gets reported as spam. He will probably abandon his Gmail account and get a new one anyways. \n\nI hope this answers your question (and then some!)",

This would decrease the likelihood of sending out surveys to users that would not reply, or reply unfavorably, or stray from the narrative. \n\nAdditionally the other user said it would have been better to make a public post. I disagree. If you want to keep your project contained, you would just ping individual users. \n\nLastly, as far as \u201cis it the real Reddit admin account\u201d, I\u2019m highly confident that it is. You couldn\u2019t spoof the account. And if a rogue employee or hacker took over the account, they would have certainly used it to target high profile accounts or phish for credentials or credit card info.",

Every landlord I've ever had needed my social, and so I didn't think anything of it.. Blah blah blah. Bottom line, he got my social, my ID and my email address. Then he asked for money, and I read over the sham lease and realized it was a scam.   \n\n\nSo he didn't get my money, but he got my information, which he could sell to an identity thief on the dark web very easily. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI already closed all 3 major credit agencies, and then LexisNexis Innovis and Chexsystems as well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3 of these credit agencies require mailed pins to unfreeze. For the other 3, I added additional layers of security so they cannot be unfroze by the hackers. Added a pin to my IRS account. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do not have any assets AT ALL. There's no way they could open up a card with a max over 5000$. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWill file local and IRS reports tomorrow. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThinking about finally getting an Illinois license. And reporting my new license to the IRS, local government, postal service, banks. Who else would I want to report my new drivers license to?   \n\n\nI could also get a new email address. Is this a necessary measure? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I better off telling a potential new landlord that my credit is froze but I can send him a photo through my Experian account, or thawing it for a small period of time and letting him check? That second option is still unsettling.",

Which I clicked. Like an idiot.\n\nSooooo, after half a second to think about it, I realized I really didn't know where this email came from, and didn't trust it so I reported it as phishing. Turned off my internet, ran anti-malware software, backed up all my crap, ran ccleaner to wipe all my cookies and pre-fills (I don't have many), reset my passwords from my phone, then ran my anti-malware software in safe-mode, which still found nothing.\n\nI literally have no idea what if anything went through/was taken. I don't even know if it's my saving grace or completely meaningless that I'm about to upgrade my pc.\n\nAny advice is welcome.\n\nEdit:  \nI also changed emails for things that were linked in any way to banking or credit cards.\n\nIs there more I should do?  \n",

It's my first time posting anything this serious, so go easy on me.\n\nYesterday I received an odd request from a friend on Instagram: they had trouble logging on to their account and wanted to send a verification my way. Stupidly I didn't ask any questions or even think twice about it, and only realized something was wrong after it was done.\n\nThe message read as follows:\n\n\"I was trying to log in to my Instagram page on my new phone and it asks me to find someone to help give me a code, Instagram gave me suggestions from two friends and you are one of them, the other person is not online . Could you help me receive the code please?\"\n\nAfterwards I received a text message from Facebook, which I sent a screenshot of to what I thought was my friend. I didn't think anything of it until I saw a discussion in a group I'm in regarding a similar phishing attempt. I realized what happened then, but it was too late...\n\nMy password, email and phone number were all changed, and none of the alert emails I got from Meta did anything to mitigate the damage. I've gone through all the suggestions given to me when I hit the login button and submitted like 6 or so video selfies, but all have been rejected to date. For some reason none of the other support options work, and the new phone number is a nonexistent hodgepodge of numbers. My only solace is I was able to use my other social media to warn my friends so they don't get hit with the same issue.\n\nThere's nothing really valuable on my account, since it's just used for talking to friends and browsing, but I have 3 years worth of memes saved on it and some of those conversations aren't meant for strangers to see (nothing illegal/immoral, but definitely heart to heart stuff). \n\nIf anyone has any experience with this type of attack, anywhere or anyone I can go to, a better support line than what Meta has to offer, or any kind of advice, please, let me know.",

I said well sure, let me see. Got a link: [https://unitedarenacup.com/teams](https://unitedarenacup.com/teams). Done some digging, some of the links on that site goes to a twitch esports channel called  UnitedProSeries and its affiliated accounts. Looked around on those sites and found [https://united.gg/](https://united.gg/). Looking between the two, there is clear evidence that there is stolen assets to hide what they are doing. Looked around seen one or two mentions of this site on a steam community hub, but nothing else.  \n\n\nHope this helps!",

Verified phishing can be shut down.  Technically legal survey promotions and other shady messaging may not qualify to be shut down. It can become quite the legal technicality. \n\n- if it's phishing, what brand is being impersonated? Banks and the IRS may purchase services to take out phishing but there is a ton of phishing targeting games, unemployment, or other generic brands that don't have anyone paid to go after it. Coordinated consumer protection is hap-hazard at best. \n\n-  it's very common to purchase or compromise legitimate infrastructure for a phishing operation. This can complicate taking down the infrastructure of the attack. I would imagine forwarding and back up infrastructure are going to be a major aspect no matter if it's a 1-800 number or a URL so that if one resource goes down more are brought online. \n\n- the stupid logistics of getting an email with a phone number can create a hot potato situation. Who is responsible for dealing with that? Your email provider may try to improve email blocking but the number is probably not getting reported to the carriers or provider for investigation. \n\nSorry I don't have better info. These are just some ideas off the top of my head.",

An Internet search disclosed that the number had been used in similar  come-ons for at least 3 months, and was still operating.  Apparently, others had called the number and had been instructed to load remote-control software on their systems so that the person at the other end could \"fix\" whatever problem they claimed was going on.  The goal seems clearly to be a takeover of someone's PC and probably to take control of financial accounts. \n I would think that's something that is clearly illegal almost everywhere that an 800 number would terminate.\n\nI guess the thing I'm most interested in is why the perpetrators can continue to operate.  Somewhere, in some jurisdiction, someone is paying a telco for the service on that number.  All the world's phone systems are going to deliver the call to the same line, using the same SS7 routing.  So to me, law enforcement at the terminus of the call ought to be interested in that fraud.\n\nI just really don't understand how they are able to keep working the scam with an identifiable (and presumably traceable) termination for the call.  If nothing else, follow the money - who's paying for the line?\n\nDoes that make sense?",

The initial text might not be an actual phishing attempt but if you respond they know that your phone number is valid and that you are reading their texts. \n\nSince your phone number is active, they will later send you more targeted phishing texts using any personal information they gathered from before.\n\nIt is best to never respond to unwanted texts like this or click on any links. If you have an iPhone, you can block spam texts like this with my free app, [Dont Text](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dont-text/id1540836811)",

For the past few months I've been getting hit with quite a few random group text chats that are just obvious phishing nets, many people responding to them, which starts a whole other mess of a chain in my messages.\n\n_____\n\n\n* The text looks like it's being started by an email account (first sender is an email, the rest are all phone numbers), and then sent to others, including me\n\n\n* every single number in the list has the same 3 digits as mine, just the last 4 changed around. \n\n* AT&T has a feature that allows you to report Phone Numbers, but now of reporrting someone using emails through iMessage to spam.\n\n* Is anyone else getting these, and have you had any luck stopping them? Any ideas?\n\nThanks /r/phishing community",

        "selftext": "I seem to be getting more emails lately that are clearly fraudulent, but don't seem to contain a phishing line.  For example I had a fake order confirmation from Amazon with a bogus address, thanking me for ordering a $700 monitor to be sent to some guy in Kansas.  Yet every link in the mail was a legitimate Amazon URL, right down to the one to my orders page, which of course showed no such order.  The only thing in it I couldn't confirm was the 800 number.\n\nThen today I got this one, with no URLs in it at all:\n\n>Your subscription for Fire-Wall Anti-Theft Security has been  automatically renewed this year and we have charged your bank account  with $465.87.  \n>  \n>You have subscribed for our security program a year back and that was  a free service for a year as you have not discontinued the services so  the subscription has been automatically renewed.  \nYour annual  subscription is set to renew on April 23, 2021, if you have any question  about this software kindly get in touch with our Product Security Team  at **+1 (800) 484-1379.**  \n>  \n>We hope you liked our services and being our existing customer your 2 home devices are covered under this security program.  \n>  \n>**Benefits of this security program are as under: -**  \n>  \n>Unlimited Technical Support For 2 Devices  \nPrevents Hacking  \nStops Spywares  \nStops Virus Attacks  \nData Security  \n>  \n>**Service Contract and Annual Renewal Details: -**  \n>  \n>Annual Subscription Amount: \u00a0 $465.87  \nPro License Activation Date \u00a0: \u00a0April 23, 2021  \nNumber of Devices Covered : \u00a0 02  \n>  \n>If you need any information about this annual charge or you would  like to discontinue with our services please connect with us immediately  at **+1 (800) 484-1379.**  \nIf  we do not hear from you within 24 hours we will continue the charge  every year till the time we get verbal consent from you to discontinue  the services.  \n>  \n>Regards,  \n>  \n>**Fire-Wall Anti-Theft Security Team**  \n**Helpline Number +1 (800) 484-1379**\n\nObviously I haven't signed up for any such service, and I highly doubt they have any means to \"charge \\[my\\] bank account.\"  But again, no phishing line to click on.\n\nSo what's the scam here?  They can't somehow cause me phone charges for calling an 800 number, can they?  Or will they just try to fast-talk me out of personal information if I call it?",

Obviously didn\u2019t open the attachment but I have never had a phishing email get past my spam and include my full name, it makes me wonder if they managed to get any of my passwords. Should I overhaul all my passwords? I use a password manager and update them regularly but it was off putting that they used my full name in the subject and attachment of the email. Thanks!",

A lot of others online have reported that they also received the same email and that our information would be sent to the dark web if said institution did not reach out to them to negotiate something. I already emailed the application website and have not received a response.

If not a get yourself added so that they can start recognizing your logo.\n\nSearch for people exploiting your brand by searching phishtank. Google \\`company phishing kit\\` and see if anyone has replicated your login page and is bundling it with a phishing kit. \n\nContact the other vendors like webroot, cyren etc - and ask them if they can start to monitor your brand. Unless there is a lot of mail impersonating you... not likely that they will add you very easily.\n\nIf you are \\`just\\` a company trying to prevent inbound phishing.... google \"phishing protection software\" or \"phishing protection service\" and start talking to vendors.",

My first thoughts would be some sort of sim swap or man-in-the-middle type of attack. I'm having a really hard time believing they **just** want our cell numbers. I mean, if they really wanted them so bad, it wouldn't take an OSINT master to find them online. Plus, if the end goal is a phone call to continue the ruse, wouldn't they be busted the moment they spoke? They won't sound like the executive. They also couldn't write well in the email, with all the spell check and grammar tools freely available online, why would they speak any better over the phone?\n\nI'm really tempted to spin up a throwaway VoiP number and do some good ol' fashioned scam baiting to see what's up, but I figure I'd ask this subreddit first in case this is a common thing.",

But I don't particularly care about my Pinterest account (it was empty anyway), I'm more concerned about how easily that legit-looking email slipped through, it's the first time that happened to me on gmail. Yeah, the reason I want to know if this particular email was phishing is because I do reuse logins when they're disposable and not worth remembering, like stock image websites and such. Even if they got stolen I wouldn't be bothered, the info in them is also fake. But unimportant or not, I'll have to sign up all over again if I lose them, which would be a pain. But if this wasnt phishing, changing the passwords unnecessarily is also a pain. So basically I'm trying to avoid that extra work by figuring this out.",

The format of this was something like https://foo.example.com/?q=<zoom meeting url>. \n\nI checked with zoom, and the meeting code given is a valid meeting.\n\nI could imagine a couple of things going on here: \n\n1. The link doesn't actually go to a zoom meeting, It just has that to make people more likely to click on it. I doubt this is the case since the email wasn't about zoom to begin with.\n2. The link does go to a zoom meeting and they have some zoom exploit that they are going to use. Seems unlikely and would be dangerous. Also why would they include the redirection domain in this case? for click tracking?\n3. The link does go to a zoom meeting and something/somebody on the call is going to try and convince me to do something more.\n\nAnyone have a clue what their racket is?\n\nI'm really tempted to join the zoom call directly and/or visit the original link in a Linux VM, but this is probably a bad idea.",

Maybe spearfishing for more information and/or credentials (if the email header shows anything suspicious). Be careful with attachments in any form, even some text formats can contain evil stuff these days. \n\nUsually phisher don't like speaking on the phone very much... So if you interested try to arrange a phone call or maybe a video call anyone serious will gladly talk to you... In proper English and with a connection better then the average Indian call center xD \n\nCheers",

        "selftext": "I use Airbnb so people comes to my apartment, I went on vacations for a week, I decided to block my calendar so that I didn\u2019t host anyone because my apartment was going to be alone and when I came back I noticed that my second iPhone was stolen....\n\nTwo days later I started receiving several sms messages telling me that my phone was turned on, connected to the internet, located, \u201cchanges were made to the phone\u201d, etc... with a link to view the phone on the map.\n\nThe url was http://appIeconnect.la/56556\n\nNotice that there is an uppercase letter, when you open the site it becomes lower case, the url in reality is http://appieconnect.la/56556\n\nThe url they send has a number that identifies you and ONLY works when someone is attacking you.\n\nBecause the link only works when someone is attacking, note that google chrome, safari and opera didn\u2019t recognize the site as suspicious and didn\u2019t raise an alert because they don\u2019t use SSL. \n\nWhen browsers start raising alerts, they change the url. This is another example: http://icloudfound.com/56556\n\nThey are using amazon web services SMS service, so messages are coming from US and (if you don\u2019t live in the US) also from local numbers, many services use that service to send two factor authentication codes, so truecaller and sms filtering apps didn\u2019t recognize the sms or phone numbers as suspicious. Sms messages also are in the language you speak, in my case Spanish, but in that moment I didn\u2019t realize that I have all my devices and services in English and should get the sms in English. \n\nThe sms number was sent to my personal phone number, not to the number of the SIM card that was on that phone, the sms includes iPhone model, capacity \n\nWhen you open the site you see a PERFECT iCloud site, with proper colors, perfect animations, responsive (works great in phones and desktop browsers), perfect canvas.\n\nThey ask for a six digit code, I didn\u2019t know what they\u2019re asking for, so I called Apple. Important thing to note here: Apple didn\u2019t tell me that they do not send sms messages when a phone is found. The site actually was asking for my pin code... they don\u2019t tell you, so in that state of mind trying to do as much as you can to screw the thief, you start typing numbers and trying to guess in order to see the map... one of the many tries could include sensitive numbers you use such as... the pin code.\n\nI think someone is selling \u201cphishing as a service\u201d they asked me for my pin because they needed it, but the \u201ccustomer\u201d may want your iCloud account so the site could ask for id and password if they need it. \n\nI work at the IT industry, so trust me: the attack it is very well planned, very well made. \n\nI\u2019ll paste the sms I got \n\nAppIe lnc.\r\nSu lPhone X 64gb silver perdido ha sido conectado a internet.

I live in Germany and this dude from the US offers me his flat in Berlin. Since he isn't present in the city, I couldn't meet or get a look at the unit in person until I've sent him a damage deposit payment and he's sent the house keys from the States. He asked for some info on me (Name, marital status, current address, phone number, skype username) and made me sign a \"lease agreement\", which looks legit enough. He sent me pictures of the place and out of excitement, I signed the document.\n\nIt was only when he gave me his bank account details (which he claims are his lawyer's bank details) that I became suspicious. I tried reverse searching the images he sent me and nothing came up. The address is real, the law firm he claims is involved is real. The thing is, the address of the bank account he sent me probably isn't, at least that's what it looks like on Whitepages. I've emailed the law firm to ask for confirmation of their involvement.\n\n**If it turns out to be a fake offer, will this signed \"lease\" give me any trouble and what can he do with that amount of personal information?**\n\nCheers.",

If he wants to \"enforce\" it, he would need to involve the German courts. Scammers aren't going to bother 99% of the time. But he might threaten to to try to extort more money from you.\n\n> what can he do with that amount of personal information?\n\nLikely identity theft. The \"good\" news is so much info is out there on all of us at this point, I doubt your risk has risen much.",

        "selftext": "I've been emailing back an forth trying to waste the time of an attempted sextortion scammer. At first they asked for a bitcoin payment but I said that was confusing so they gave me their Western Union info including: First Name, Last Name, Address. Can I report them somehow using this info? Are they one step closer to being caught since they gave me this info?\n\nEDIT: to be clear, I know this is a total scam and they actually have nothing on me. I'm positive of this for MULTIPLE reasons: they sent it to my work email which has no person associated with it, I have no webcam, I definitely did not masturbate to porn at work (or anywhere, for that matter (recently, at least (TMI?))).\n\nHere is the text of the original scam email:\n\n*THE SECOND WARNING*\n\n*You ignored my first email, but I am not going to ignore your mistakes, don\u2019t be stupid and do as I say. I know your passwords (check this email subject), I know about your daily life, your internet activities and you know nothing about me, and you must be wondering why you are getting this email, right? I installed a malware on the adult (porn) website and guess what, you visited this website to have fun (you know what I mean!). While you were watching the porn, your web browser started functioning as an RDP+keylogger, which gave me access to your display screen and camera. Right after that, my software collected all of your contacts from your Facebook account, Messenger account, and email account, then, I created a double screen video. The first part shows the video you were watching (you have a nice taste lol), and the second part shows the recording of your camera (it is you!). You have two options -*\n\n*1. First option is to ignore this email. In this case, I will send the recorded video clip of yours to all of your contacts lists, associates and social network friends. just imagine the humiliation you will feel from this. Don't forget that this can also affect your relationship as well.*\n\n*2. Second option is to pay me $2000. Since you decided to ignore my first email, the price is now $3000. We will call it a donation. In this case, I will right away delete your video and all of your information I have about you (including your contact lists) and you will never hear from me again. You can continue your daily life like this never happened.*\n\n*You will make the payment via bitcoin. If you do not know about bitcoin, search Google for \"how to buy bitcoin\". You can also get the bitcoin from sites like Bitstamp, Coinbase, Kraken, Bitcoin Atm, Localbitcoins, etc. Bitcoin (i.e. BTC) address to which you need to send $3000 is - 1AjJCkBTA8aPDLLCpW6Am1z1FKUEroQzeT*\n\n*Send exactly 0.291578 BTC to my address so i will know is you:*\n\n*1AjJCkBTA8aPDLLCpW6Am1z1FKUEroQzeT*\n\n*(copy it and paste - it\u2019s case sensitive)*\n\n*If you are thinking to go to the police, good luck,I am from russia and I have taken every step to make sure that this email cannot be traced back to me. You have 72 hours to pay me. I have a special pixel in this email, and at this moment, I know that you have read this email.*\n\n*Contact me on this email address* [*chupachu147@gmail.com*](mailto:chupachu147@gmail.com) *copy to* [*manpachu147@aol.com*](mailto:manpachu147@aol.com) *with this subject: 012VIPERMARVO- RESTOREKEYPC4102934 After this steps you will receive through email the key and a decrypt tutorial.*\n\n*Remember to send the exact amount as above! This way I will know it\u2019s from you. Do not be angry at me. This is just my job, and you are not the only person I caught.*\n\n*Be angry at your fantasies - if you didn\u2019t visit those sites for adults you would have no problem.. but now...*\n\n*I am waiting for your bitcoin.*\n\n*Remember, time is ticking..*",

        "selftext": "My mom got me involved in this one last night. \n\nShe was trying to set up my HBONOW account on her Roku and went to the wrong website to type in the activation code. When it didn\u2019t work, they said they needed to call me. I figured they just needed to verify that it was my account, especially since I had signed into HBONOW on my Smart TV earlier in the day, or that I might have to upgrade to a different tier for multiple screens, like Netflix. I was in the middle of something and was trying to move it along, so I wasn\u2019t too suspicious until it got really bad. \n\nThe caller immediately launched into a spiel about \u201ca one-time service fee of $29.99\u201d to activate the account on the Roku. I asked why I needed to pay thirty dollars for a service that I\u2019ve been using for months at $15. She told me not to worry, it was a one-time fee, just for today, can I go ahead and start that for you? I asked again exactly what the fee was for, and she said something to the effect of \u201cindependent service fee for the Roku.\u201d My mom was texting me the whole time this was happening asking for updates. I said alright and gave her my bank card info. \n\nShe seemed to have some trouble understanding me, as I had to repeat my card number several times (I have a confusing card number with some repeating digits, so I\u2019m kind of used to this when I give my number over the phone) but I got a little wary when she repeated my card number back to me to confirm. Usually, I\u2019ve had people say that they can\u2019t repeat the number back to me for security purposes, but can I confirm how many X\u2019s appear, or have me repeat the number. \n\nAfter confirming my bank card number, she asked for my HBONOW password. I really started to get suspicious here, but I figured it would be over soon and I could get back to my project. I gave her what I thought was my password (I use two or three passwords, so it\u2019s always gotta be one of those) but it turns out it was wrong. This prompted her to ask me to reset my password. I said \u201cyou know, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary, and I really don\u2019t want to continue this right now.\u201d She insisted we were almost done, that she had already sent me the email link to reset my password, just go ahead and reset it to this phrase. I said I hadn\u2019t received an email and that I didn\u2019t want to continue this. At this point, the call dropped. \n\nThe call had been dropped several times throughout this ordeal, but she always called me back immediately. While waiting for her to call me back, my mom and I determined that this was a phishing scheme and that if she called me back, I would tell them to stuff it and leave me alone. I also got the email to reset my password, but did not click on the link. \n\nShe called me back and before I was able to tell her that I was done with her bs, she said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just give me your gmail password and I\u2019ll sign in and reset the password for you.\u201d\n\nNow they\u2019ve made me angry. \n\nI said there was no way in hell I was going to give them my Gmail password, I did not want to pay any fee and I was done with this conversation. She transferred me to a \u201ctechnician\u201d who started from the beginning, with the $30 service fee. I told him that I would not be giving him any more information, that someone had just asked me for my gmail password and that I wanted to cancel everything (I wasn\u2019t sure what \u201ccanceling everything\u201d would accomplish, but I was fed up and just wanted to shout at someone.) \n\nHe transferred me to a \u201cLevel 3 Technician\u201d who again started from the $30 service fee. He asked me if I wanted to go ahead and start that process and I said \u201cabsolutely not.\u201d He confirmed that I did not want to pay the fee and regretfully informed me that if I didn\u2019t pay, they wouldn\u2019t be able to set up the service. I said that was fine with me and we hung up. \n\nThey hadn\u2019t taken any money out of my bank account at that point, but on the advice of my boyfriend, I cancelled the bank card and will be calling them on Monday to get a new card. I also changed all of my passwords. \n\nNot sure if I can report this somewhere or if there\u2019s anything else I should do just to be safe, but I\u2019m sure that they\u2019re not just doing this for HBO accounts.",

So I assume I still have some old account out there still with that password that I haven't used in forever. For the life of me I can't think of any accounts... maybe an old Yahoo Account I use to have for playing the yahoo games on.\n\n\nThese phishing scams are getting unnerving. For people that never change their password, this is the reason you should change your passwords from time to time. Don't fall for this kind of garbage.",

Then closer inspection on the link i noticed a .ml at the end, which is Mali - near Nigeria of course.\n\nAnyway clicking on the link takes you to a very sophisticated phishing site of my mobile company. Even had my number listed. And had a place to login etc. Tried with a few dummy attempts and it actually is linked with the real provider so you need to have an actual account. Then the step for credit card payment must just bill straight to fresh prince of Mali. \n\nBut yeah, i was blown away with how good this was. I work in IT so was impressed that it had me give it a second glance. I'd imagine it would bank the average user. ",

        "title": "Phishing Program Checklist. After 5 years of managing phishing training programs here is what I've learned:",
        "selftext": "1. Agreement\n    1. This should involve a small stakeholder \u201cteam\u201d from various departments that all give support and act as liaisons for the effort: Infosec, IT (mail team & support team), Legal, HR, Corp Comm, Executive team. \n2. Transparency\n    1. This should not be a \u201csecret\u201d project. The success of the program in building trust with your end users and changing behavior rely heavily on the fact that they do not feel \u201ctricked\u201d or they can\u2019t trust the infosec team.\n    2. Clear communication on what the program is, why the company is doing it, and how the users will be affected (what should they expect at every turn).\n3. Tested processes.\n    1. Is there a reporting button that needs to be installed?\n    2. Do you have a simple email address for users to report to?\n    3. Have you whitelisted all potential domains for education purposes?\n        1. There is a difference from whitelisting email servers with your exchange team and whitelisting domains and URLS for ALL of your filters. I\u2019ve seen some companies with 5 layers of filtering that needed to be completed to ensure proper email delivery and education experience.\n    4. Test to IT first, and then expand to a slightly larger group across multiple forests or trees in the AD environment to make sure nothing was missed.\n4. Communications\n    1. Stakeholders: (initial program announcement, separate comm; 48 hours prior to launch as reminder) this announcement should introduce them to the project, verify the goals of the project, and identify what their role is within the project. Many of them will have team members reaching out to them with questions, so they need to have all the info to answer those questions. If you let them provide their own answers - your program will turn into a crapshoot quickly.\n    2. Security Stakeholders (48 hours prior to launch): these are the teams that make the program run smoothly. This will be those on IT support, exchange admin, infosec & IR teams responsible for blocking links and spinning up response processes. They need to be aware what is coming so they can response appropriately as calls come in. They should have relevant info on the campaign (Subject, sender, date/time, content)\n    3. Users: they should receive two communications generally - one initially announcing the program. This can be two months out from kickoff. They should receive another message 2 weeks prior to first campaign launch. This message should remind them of the program, and what they should do.\n5. Clear and simple guidance\n    1. You are training your users, not testing them. The goal of these programs should be to change user behavior, not make them feel like they failed something. Positivity.\n    2. What users need to know:\n        1. How to report stuff. Do you have a clear and simple method for them to report phishing emails (Outlook button? Simple email address to forward as attachment?). It needs to be a single, simple action to be successful. \n        2. What to stuff to report. Anything? Don\u2019t make them know the difference between SPAM and Phishing. They should be reporting anything that feels \u201cweird\u201d. Your teams should handle the SPAM stuff via properly tuned applications and architecture.\n    3. It\u2019s okay if they give each other a heads up about the program. While we don\u2019t want to do it, if it were a real phishing email that is what we would want them to do. So while it is tempting to scold when they do this, you need to encourage them that the action they took was correct.\n    4. IT Support and stakeholders. They need to know how to respond to users inquiring about whether or not its a \u201ctest\u201d. Regardless it should always be the same response - \u201cyes this is a phishing email, please report it via\u2026\u201d and constantly reinforcing the desired behavior and positive acknowledgement that they identified a threat.\n6. Metrics & Reporting\n    1. Everyone wants the click rate - but this is mostly bogus, so don\u2019t fall into that trap. Its a metric senior leadership will want to know - but having them understand the lack of strength in the actual reporting is key. This data point does not tell the whole story (difficulty, outside factors like time of year, vacations, holidays, trending media coverage, etc.). \n        1. Accepting the click rate SHOULD vary from 7% - 35% consistently. If you are consistently hitting below 10%, you are failing to train your users properly.\n    2. Focus on getting report rates. # of users who reported. This shows behavior change consistently across campaigns and shows program effectiveness.\n        1. This also allows you to empower your IR team - if you are having 50% of your users reporting emails, they can reduce their response time to take action. Executives love that shit.\n    3. Role based metrics - break out into interesting stories: Executives, People Managers, Users, Contractors, Temps, IT/Privileged Accts.\n    4. Average time to report sounds fun but isn\u2019t a clear number - you have no idea how many people are in meetings for 3 hours at a time before they get their email. Too many outliers.\n    5. Region - if you\u2019re global keep it to  bigger buckets (North America, EMEA, APAC)\n    6. Employment time. This is good to show training effectiveness for new hires versus long term and can provide opps for awareness.",

Could it be true that they took control of my camera and mic.....I just don't know but am terrified. They warmed they will contact all my phone contacts and show them photos and videos that I was looking at the porn videos. It popped on my phone so I did look at them. But am definitely worrying myself. I closed my email after receiving the 3rd email today. Closed all social media, texted all my contacts warning them all and changed all my passwords and phone numbers. Cops continue to say not to worry. I feel so alone.",

Looked like an email wrote in a text editor, no bold, no company logo, etc.. I checked the VAT number and company exist. The web page did not exist and the general email was support@companyname.countrycode\n\nI sent a message and the response was the email does not exist. Meanwhile I looked on the person on the internet and found him on LinkedIN, a pretty respectable profile. Interesting is the company was more or less linked with the company that they worked, maybe a francise. I sent him a message and he told me that he did not send the message and his identity was stolen.\n\nNow, my first question is why somebody will do something like this considering that in the initial email was no any link and the email address is not valid? Though behind of this email address was not any gmail or something else? \n\nAnd the second question is any danger that I sent an email to an email which does not exist?\n\nThank you guys!",

Or the email provider has closed the account because they suspect fraud.\n\nI always recommend the following things.\n\n1. Don't reply to emails from unknown sources\n2. Report any emails to you companies security team\n3. Unless absolutely necessary for your job, turn of out of office messages in your emails for external contacts, and if you do need them to be on (i.e you deal with a lot of external clients) do not put contact telephone numbers in an external out of office.\n\n*Edits for spelling and formatting, mobile formatting sucks",

Or perhaps it's just your mind going in overdrive mode due to fear. \n\nHomosexuality or porn is something a person would want to hide from his friends/family out of shame. So scammers create a template ransom email with either of those things (or if they are feeling fancy then both !) and then just send it out to a vast number of people.\n\nNow you would feel that since you were searching up things on homosexuality recently it is specifically directed at you...but well, millions do that everyday, so not specific. \n\nAnd like a user said, sometimes they would have even more details, but that is easy to obtain with data breaches. I have found my name, phone number and even password on sale on the dark web when I did a security check on Google. \n\nAnd finally like you said in your post, you don't visit porn sites, so clearly the email is a steaming hot pile of shit.

        "selftext": "I got an email \u2018I RECORDED YOU! and threatening me\n\n3 days ago, I woke up and saw that my Instagram was logged out of. I tried logging in, and the password was incorrect. I clicked I forgot my password and it said they sent an email to verify but the email didn\u2019t belong to me. I rushed to my own email. And saw the \u2018I RECORDED YOU\u2019 sent from MYSELF to ME. The email said they recorded me watching adult stuff and demanded money in bitcoin. \n\nI then saw all the emails of my social accounts passwords being changed. My steam, my instagram, my discord, my Spotify and even my Roblox. This email is what I used for all my accounts and foolish of me to do so, they all have the exact same password, the same password I also used for my email. \n\nThey changed the passwords and did that while I was sleeping so the emails were hours ago. I then noticed that they sent the exact same blackmailing emailing they sent me to hundreds of others in different languages, but from my email. I quickly got all my accounts back but they also changed the email to my Instagram so I couldn\u2019t get it. \n\nI looked at my Instagram from my friends account and saw that they unarchived all my posts from years ago, and changed my insta highlights name to \u2018Mexico\u2019 and \u2018Signapore\u2019 and they made my account public. I contacted Instagram and provided selfie proof that it was me trying to get in and that I was hacked. They sent me a log in link to reset my password and kicked the hacker out in an hour from another email of mine. \n\nOnce I got into my account I realized that 3 of my DMs were pinned. I\u2019m from a non English speaking country and those 3 DMs were the only ones I spoke English with bc they were my online friends. \n\nI then changed all my password to unique and long ones in my email and all my accounts. I have 5 emails in total and I wanted to make sure they were safe too so I logged into them. I looked at their activity and saw that they\u2019ve also been trying to get into those but incorrect passwords(thankfully those emails had different passwords) they probably found my other emails bc all my emails are linked to one another for log in codes and as backups. \n\nI looked up have I been pwned and yes, my email and passwords were pwned. I then realized that my email that got hacked had activity for over a month of them all over the world trying to get in. Luckily, Microsoft always blocked them out for unusual activity. \n\nA month ago I wasn\u2019t aware of this and thought I entered too many passwords and that\u2019s why it got locked. I tried for two weeks or so and finally got my account back but also in the process, let the hacker in too. They only got in once and they sent dozens of spam emails to others, threatening them from my email. \n\nI changed my aliasas for all my emails and gave them long and unique passwords, also enabling a 2fa. \n\nI feel extremely paranoid now, also thinking my iPad or my iPhone might have a malware installed and that I\u2019m being watched. I can\u2019t stop myself from reviewing my accounts activity every half an hour to see if they\u2019re still trying to get in. This actually scarred me and made me extremely paranoid. Am I in trouble? Am I being watched? ",

        "selftext": "Received an email this morning from my own email account. Is there anything I should do besides changing my password and adding two-factor authentication? What else might be compromised?\n\n\n\nHello pervert, I've sent this message from your Microsoft account.\u00a0I want to inform you about a very bad situation for you. However, you can benefit from it, if you will act wis\u0435ly.\u00a0Have you heard of Pegasus? This is a spyware program that installs on computers and smartphones and allows hackers to monitor the activity of device owners. It provides access to your webcam, messengers, emails, call records, etc. It works well on Android, iOS, macOS\u00a0and Windows. I guess, you already figured out where I\u2019m getting at.\u00a0It\u2019s been a few months since I installed it on all your\u00a0d\u0435vi\u0441\u0435s\u00a0because you were not quite choosy about what links to click on the int\u0435rn\u0435t. During this period, I\u2019ve learned about all aspects of your private life, but\u00a0\u043en\u0435 is of special significance to me.\u00a0I\u2019ve recorded many videos of you jerking off to highly controversial\u00a0\u0440\u043ern videos. Given that the \u201cquestionable\u201d genre is almost always the same, I can conclude that you have sick \u0440\u0435rv\u0435rsi\u043en.  \nI doubt you\u2019d want your friends, family and co-workers to know about it. However, I can do it in a few clicks.\u00a0Every number in your contact Iist\u00a0will suddenly receive these vid\u0435\u043es \u2013 on WhatsApp, on Telegram, on Instagram, on Facebook, on email \u2013 everywhere. It is going to be a tsunami that will sweep away everything in its path, and first of all, your f\u043erm\u0435r life.  \nDon\u2019t think of yourself as an innocent victim. No one knows where your \u0440\u0435rv\u0435rsi\u043en might lead in the future, so consider this a kind of deserved \u0440unishm\u0435nt to stop you.\u00a0I\u2019m some kind of God who sees everything. However, don\u2019t panic.\u00a0As we know, God is merciful and forgiving,\u00a0\u00a0and so do I. But my\u00a0m\u0435r\u0441y\u00a0is not free.\u00a0Transfer\u00a0**1300$**\u00a0to my Litecoin (LTC) wallet:\u00a0**ltc1qcqh6yzkdrmfpn4qqrs7hj7fethm3tvhpwx9td0**\u00a0Once I receive confirmation of the transaction, I will\u00a0\u0440\u0435rmanently\u00a0delete all videos compromising you, uninst\u0430ll Pegasus from all of your devices, and disappear from your life. You can be sure \u2013 my benefit is only money. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t be writing to you, but destroy your life without a word in a second.\u00a0I\u2019ll be notified when you open my email, and from that moment you have exactly\u00a0**48 hours**\u00a0to send the money. If cryptocurrencies are unchartered waters for you, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s very simple. Just google \u201ccrypto exchange\u201d or \"buy Litecoin\" and then it will be no harder than buying some useless stuff on Amazon.\u00a0I strongly warn you against the following:  \n\\* Do not reply to this email. I've sent it from your Microsoft account.\\* Do not contact the police. I have access to all your d\u0435vi\u0441\u0435s, and as soon as I find out you ran to the cops, videos will be published.\\* Don\u2019t try to reset or destroy your d\u0435vi\u0441\u0435s. As I mentioned above: I\u2019m monitoring all your activity, so you either agree to my terms or the vid\u0435\u043es are \u0440ublished.\u00a0Also, don\u2019t forget that cryptocurrencies are anonymous, so it\u2019s impossible to identify me using the provided \u0430ddr\u0435ss.\u00a0Good luck, my perverted friend. I hope this is the last time we hear from each other.And some friendly advice: from now on, don\u2019t be so careless about your online security.",

I didn\u2019t have a phone call with them and clicked the thumbs down option in the email. When I clicked this it took me to a page that looked like a DoorDash customer survey. I didn\u2019t give any info and just typed in that I didn\u2019t call - I was scared someone was trying to get into my account. Then it hit me that THIS was the scam. I downloaded Norton and ran a scan to make sure there was no malware/spyware installed. The scan came back clear but I was getting error messages like \u201cyour connection is not private\u201d when I did log back online. Im worried that my MacBook is compromised. I turned off wifi and when I clicked my shortcut to Gmail, the screen said \u201cit looks like you\u2019re not online\u201d which I\u2019ve never seen before - it\u2019s usually that no wifi dinosaur game. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do at this point and appreciate any advice in advance.

I hand copy the link provided since it is not highlighted blue in the text, and I get taken to a page where I am able to input my information. The reason my scam meter wasn't going off is because it never asked for a credit card, just address, email, and phone number. I input everything, but started getting weirded out, so I never hit submit. But since I was on my phone, I didn't open a new tab when I did some panic googling of USPS text scams. So when I revert the page back to the data input page it has to reload, which makes me think they still got the information despite me not clicking submit. I deleted everything I input and then immediately went to my Gmail (which I inputted) and removed my phone number from all the 2fa options. It took a couple of minutes between inputting my email, discovering the scam, and going through the process of removing me phone number from my email, so do you think they got into my email? Now that I think about this, I just changed my password to my email to be extra certain. Should I be worried about scammers potentially having my address and phone number, or even email?  Or was this actually USPS since they never asked for a credit card number lol.",

They don't have a zip code, but somehow they have your phone number or apple id\n3. They can't just look the zip code up from the rest of the address\n4. For that matter is not having a valid zip code a reason for customs to block a parcel?\n5. They don't contact the sender, whose information should be on the customs declaration\n6. If customs were to contact you they won't use iMessage\n7. Absurdly short timescale so you don't get a chance to really think about how this must be a scam\n8. The website link isn't for customs which would be .gov, it isn't even USPS which is \"usps.com\", it's just something that just about vaguely resembles usps.\n9. The message is \"from\" customs, but they say \"Have a great day from the USPS team!\"\n10. USPS will never wish you a great day\n11. \"Please reply with a Y...\" - iMessage has a feature that blocks links in messages from unknown numbers to block spam and scams like this. However links will work for numbers you have replied to, so this is a typical scammer workaround to that feature.\n\nI'm sure there's something I've missed",

In extremely rare case scenarios, they can find a way to do the same without the need of victim's interaction, but again, that's *extremely* rare. The only relevant information they gathered on you was your IP address and some information about your phone, and those alone are mostly useless.\n\nThe data collected from those websites are often used to further perform frauds or collect emails for spam. Assuming you really didn't input any data, that won't be a problem.\n\nYet, if you feel like your phone is infected somehow, you can either run an antivirus to scan your phone or factory reset it if that's not an issue for you.\n\nHope this helps.",

        "selftext": "Backstory: I just got a new phone and while going through and trying to get rid of unused stuff, I happened to look in my junk mail. When I opened it, there was only one email and it was sent to me Friday (shown below). It\u2019s not that I literally have anything to worry about, but it\u2019s the thought that bugs me.\n\nSUBJECT: YOU HAVE BEEN HACKED\n\nHello pervert, I've sent this message from your iCloud-mail.\n \nI want to inform you about a very bad situation for you. However, you can benefit from it, if you will act wis\u0435ly.\n \nHave you heard of Pegasus? This is a spyware program that installs on computers and smartphones and allows hackers to monitor the activity of device owners. It provides access to your webcam, messengers, emails, call records, etc. It works well on Android, iOS, and Windows. I guess, you already figured out where I\u2019m getting at.\n \nIt\u2019s been a few months since I installed it on all your d\u0435vi\u0441\u0435s because you were not quite choosy about what links to click on the int\u0435rn\u0435t. During this period, I\u2019ve learned about all aspects of your private life, but \u043en\u0435 is of special significance to me.\n \nI\u2019ve recorded many videos of you jerking off to highly controversial \u0440\u043ern videos. Given that the \u201cquestionable\u201d genre is almost always the same, I can conclude that you have sick \u0440\u0435rv\u0435rsi\u043en.\n\nI doubt you\u2019d want your friends, family and co-workers to know about it. However, I can do it in a few clicks.\n \nEvery number in your contact Iist will suddenly receive these vid\u0435\u043es \u2013 on WhatsApp, on Telegram, on Instagram, on Facebook, on email \u2013 everywhere. It is going to be a tsunami that will sweep away everything in its path, and first of all, your f\u043erm\u0435r life.\n\nDon\u2019t think of yourself as an innocent victim. No one knows where your \u0440\u0435rv\u0435rsi\u043en might lead in the future, so consider this a kind of deserved \u0440unishm\u0435nt to stop you.\n \nI\u2019m some kind of God who sees everything. However, don\u2019t panic. As we know, God is merciful and forgiving,  and so do I. But my m\u0435r\u0441y is not free.\n \nTransfer 1000 USD to my Litecoin (LTC) wallet: ltc1q65mr6s7cn2f4rskyjvw95dq807af53a2tv708r\n \nOnce I receive confirmation of the transaction, I will \u0440\u0435rmanently delete all videos compromising you, uninst\u0430ll Pegasus from all of your devices, and disappear from your life. You can be sure \u2013 my benefit is only money. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t be writing to you, but destroy your life without a word in a second.\n \nI\u2019ll be notified when you open my email, and from that moment you have exactly 48 hours to send the money. If cryptocurrencies are unchartered waters for you, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s very simple. Just google \u201ccrypto exchange\u201d or \"buy Litecoin\" and then it will be no harder than buying some useless stuff on Amazon.\n \nI strongly warn you against the following:\n* Do not reply to this email. I've sent it from your iCloud mail.\n* Do not contact the police. I have access to all your d\u0435vi\u0441\u0435s, and as soon as I find out you ran to the cops, videos will be published.\n* Don\u2019t try to reset or destroy your d\u0435vi\u0441\u0435s. As I mentioned above: I\u2019m monitoring all your activity, so you either agree to my terms or the vid\u0435\u043es are \u0440ublished.\n \nAlso, don\u2019t forget that cryptocurrencies are anonymous, so it\u2019s impossible to identify me using the provided \u0430ddr\u0435ss.\n \nGood luck, my perverted friend. I hope this is the last time we hear from each other.\nAnd some friendly advice: from now on, don\u2019t be so careless about your online security.",

You read about AI, judging by your browser history, and still didn't understand anything?  \nTechnologies have stepped far forward, and now hackers like me use artificial intelligence.  \n  \nThanks to it, I can get not only access to your webcam and record your fun with highly controversial video  \n(I recorded it also, but now that's not the point), but also to all your devices and not only yours.  \nAnd I saved a special sauce for this dish. I went further and sent malicious links to all your contacts from your account.  \n  \nYes, someone was smarter and realized that this was a trap and you were hacked, but believe me,  \nabout 70% of your contact list (and these are your friends, colleagues, and family) bought into my scam.  \nThey have as many skeletons in their closet as you do. Some turn out to be hidden homosexuals...  \n  \nI have accumulated and analyzed a huge amount of compromising data on you and those with whom you communicate.  \nVery soon I'll start a crossfire - everyone will receive the full history of correspondence  \n(and there are enough of \"sensitive moments\") and recordings from the other contact's webcam.  \nI can go further and put all these files, as well as the recorded fun of you and your hacked contacts with \"hardcore videos\" into the public domain.  \n  \nYou can imagine, it will be a real sensation!  \nAnd everyone will understand where it came from - from you.  \nFor all your contacts and, you will be enemy number one. Even your relatives will take a long time to forgive you and forget such a family shame...  \n  \nIt will be the real end of the world. The only difference is that there will be not four horsemen of the apocalypse, but only one - (=  \nBut there is no such thing as a completely black stripe without any white dots.  \nLuckily for you, in my case the \"Three M Rule\" comes into play - Money, Money and Money again.  \n  \nI'm not interested in your worthless life, I'm interested in people from whom I can profit.  \nAnd today you are one of them.  \n  \nThat's why: Transfer $1190 in Bitcoin to: 18bGv3kKTbj6AYfuoFivNFv99WdaxqXd6U ...within 48 hours!  \n  \nYou don't know how to use cryptocurrencies? Use Google, everything is simple.  \n  \nOnce payment is received, I will delete all information associated with you and you will never hear from me again.  \nRemember one thing: my crypto address is anonymous, and I generated this letter in your mailbox and sent it to you.  \nYou can call the cops, do whatever you want - they won't find me, my demands won't change, but you'll just waste precious time.  \n  \nThe clock is ticking. Tick tock, a minute out of 48 hours has passed right now. An hour will soon pass, and in two days your old life will pass forever.  \nEither goodbye forever (if I get my payment), or hello to a brave new world in which there will be no place for you.  \n  \nHasta La Vista, Baby!  \nP.S.

He knew my name, the last 4 digits of my bank card and the town I live in. He said there was suspicious activity on my account. which Chase has blocked. He said there were two ebay payments attempted in Manchester and he said \"As you are from Bedford we noted it as suspicious\". So the scammer knows my address details.  He asked me to check what my balance was on my account which I refused to tell him. I asked him can I call you back but he said there is not a direct number to the fraud department. I was started to get stressed and I asked him if he could hold a minute and he said I will send you a text message which is sent the usual way you receive messages from Chase. A text comes through from Chase which provided a verification code which he asked to know, again I refused to tell him. He then said I am going to have to block your account as its suspicious that you dont know your balance or your verification code (I know realise he was trying to use verification details to get access to my account). I then said, I feel pressured and he then said \"How am I pressuring you you stupid bitch, I am going to rape and murder you in the woods\" I then hung up. Quite upsetting, but the scam was sophisticated. just wanted to let people know. ",

        "selftext": "There's this free internet scam that's been going around in my town. It asks us to open rima2d (dot) top, which redirects us to the scam page. Curiosity got the better of me so I clicked a button there. After that, I noticed it redirected us to some pages before returning to the current one. I tried to check the pages by clicking the back buttons, and I think it masked (?) a purchase confirmation page from my cellular provider (Telkomsel). The page then sends an OTP code to my phone without me doing anything. I think the purpose of this scam is to make people subscribe to a service from their cellular provider.\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. How do they know my phone number without me telling them? I noticed they somehow detected it from my internet (I tried changing my cellular provider, and then the purchase confirmation page changed accordingly).\n2. Now I'm kinda worried they can get the OTP. How do I make sure there's no malicious app/code that forwards my message to them?\n3. I foolishly click the link from my phone as is. I didn't want to wait to set up any emulator. So any advice to keep myself safe after clicking the link?\n\nI posted this before but immediately got removed by administrators, idk why? If this is the wrong sub, kindly tell me the relevant sub to post this. Thanks!",

        "selftext": "I saw an email in my junk today and opened it. I knew it was a scam or phishing email so idk why. Within there was a long message claiming they had footage of me masurbating, what I'd been looking at, etc. Then a demand for money.\n\nBut I'm wondering if I'm actually at risk? On the first instance I don't get to any unsecured or suspicious websites and haven't downloaded anything potentially compromising. Then inside the phishing email I didn't click on or open any links, nor download anything. So is there any risk to me merely from opening the email itself?\n\nI'm 99.9% sure the email, and threat isn't real, and like most scams is an attempt to scare their way into some money. But the other little part of me is still nervous. Can anyone provide some clarity as I've not been in this situation before.",

I only see these emails about once every three years, most of them go to my social media email account since SM has a horrible data breach track record.\n\nThis way, you don't get the scam emails to begin with and the one you get every few years will most likely not fit the category of email where it should belong, example:  I knew my travel email address was data breached because I received an email from Chase bank about my \"account\".  Haveibeenpwned told me about the MGM Grand data breach.  It's also more secure because someone won't automatically have half of your log in information:  your username/email for your accounts.    For instance, the email address I use for my bank is not stored on the dark web or any of my friends or families' devices.  It's completely off-grid to anyone but my financial vendors.\n\nYou will spend several hours to set this up, but once you do, you are set for life.  It only takes 15-20 minutes to get a new email address and update 10-20 web accounts once you lose that email address to a data breach.",

Now I'm scared shitless there's spyware on my laptop.  \ud83d\ude31\n\nI'd suggest increasing your spam filtering:  when you get an email you KNOW is BS, mark it as spam immediately & make yourself move on. Replying or interacting in ANY way only puts you on their \"sucker list\" and ensures future harassment (this goes for scam calls too).  If it makes you feel better, you can do a basic check of your online bank/financial accounts and run a virus program like Malwarebytes or smtg, but try not to let yourself linger in that mindspace too long.  \n\nSpammy emails truly are an algorithm: the more you let through the filter and/or reply to, the more you get.  Like watching Alex Jones vids on Youtube lol.  It's a vicious cycle.  Your mental health is more important.",

But beware that an IP address can be spoofed to look legitimate. Always make sure that you are checking for spelling mistakes or letter replacements in the company address.\n\nBest practice is to not click on anything you are not sure of and only follow trusted web addresses.

He firstly chatted with me for 2 weeks and created a good relationship. Then he mentioned he would like to help me to get more incomes by teaching me crypto through a platform called Fex Global. Which later I figured out, all the money go into this platform will go straight into his pocket. \n\nI trusted him so much because of his nice words to me and the intentions to help others. He said he has more than 10 years experiences in crypto and has business in London as he is an entrepreneur. \n\nI was so stupid to trust in him and put my money in there. He offered to send through $26,000 coins to help me trading. When I started to suspicious, I tried to withdraw my money but the platform asked me to pay the fee of more than $2,300 USDT to be able to withdraw funds. And have to pay upfront. \n\nI asked them why they do not deducted from the balance of my account and they denied to do so. My money locked up there. He pretended to be a victim. When I asked him to pay the fee as he introduced me to this platform and did not tell me anything about this fees. He denied and said that I pay for them and then I can get money back. \n\nI reported to our cybersecurity in my country in Australia. Obviously, I never get my money back. They all locked up there on Fed Global and the consultant from cybersecurity advised me do not pay any more as they are scammers. \n\nI know I am so stupid to trust this person. And now I just try to share and warn everyone out there.\n\nHope no one will fall in him again. He has multiple accounts with different name.\n\nEven the face on Facebook, he get the pictures from a tiktoker Instagram China. I guess the person in the pictures, not even him.",

        "selftext": "This post is a social experiment and the QR code you just scanned is perfectly safe and is intended as a social experiment and a neat way help bring awareness to Cybersecurity and it's professional field and inspire somebody to take interest in this complex and incredibly gratifying line of work.\n\nQR codes have become an important part of our daily lives, providing quick access to websites, products, and services. While they offer incredible convenience, scanning random or untrusted QR codes can lead to several security risks.\n\nA malicious QR code can direct your browser to a website filled with malware, potentially compromising your device's security. There's also a risk of landing on phishing sites that look legitimate but are designed to steal your personal information. These QR codes can even execute unwanted actions on your device, such as sending texts or changing settings, without your consent.\n\nUnlike traditional URLs, QR codes don't always reveal the linked address beforehand. This lack of transparency can mask the attacker's intentions, making it even easier to deceive unsuspecting victims. Furthermore, some QR codes can track and share your location, leading to serious privacy concerns.\n\nTo protect yourself from these hidden dangers, it's essential to exercise caution when scanning QR codes. Always consider the source and ensure it's from a trusted entity. Utilize a scanner with security features, and keep your device's security software up to date.\n\nWhile QR codes offer many conveniences, the potential risks associated with random or untrustworthy codes should not be ignored. With a cautious approach, you can enjoy the benefits of QR codes without compromising your digital privacy and security.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMessage to the Mod's and those who find their way here via the QR code: This post is linked to a physical copy of a QR code generated using an online QR code generator and WILL provide analytical data solely on the number of times the QR code was used to redirect to this post and WILL NOT contain any form of tracking, phishing, or malicious activity or intent.",

        "selftext": " \n\nSo I'm  (usually) a tech savvy guy but the weakest link is ALWAYS the human...\n\nAn account messages me, saying \"i'm trying to sign in my instagram on my new phone but instagram didn't grant me access they showed me 2 friends i could contact to help me recieve a link pls if you get the link send it to me so i can login\".\n\nI thought this was very unusual but i saw they followed a friend i actually know and they said their a friend of a friend and there account has been hacked.\n\nNow i guess i didn't really think about this at the time as i was doing something else but SOMEHOW they sent this link to me. they then asked me to send the link back to them. I was more worried at first about it being something related to fraud rather than hacking. Once sent i could then see i'd been logged out of instagram. Thankfully i managed to get back in quickly reset the password activated two factor authentication etc.\n\nI'm just worried, how much could they have got in the minute or so before i managed to change the password? Extracing my data? I'm maybe a little paranoid person but I'm worried they might try and blackmail me or something like that, i can't find anything they could try and blackmail me with but you never know it doesn't even have to be a real , my grandmother recently got a scam email threatening her with arrest for accessing illegal photographs. I'm more concerned they could access  my associated gmail account which has sensitive docs. i've changed the password and google shows no sign of access",

Basically it\u2019s going to be on my record and yes, that bothers me. It could very easily be leveraged for the wrong purposes.

They suggested maybe I accidentally clicked on it. I\u2019m gonna say bullshit: I would have remembered that.  How does one accidentally click on a link anyways?  These things are so easy to spot.  I\u2019ve reported three previous ones. \n\nWhat options do I have here?  Does iOS have logs I can access (they maintain it was done from an iOS device)? Does Outlook have application logs?  I\u2019ve exported all of my browser history (or have taken screenshots).  I\u2019m trying to look for the anti-smoking-gun. \n\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.",

I sent an email message to you and i'm yet to read a response back from you.  \nKindly write to me back if you received my previous email message or not.  \nThank You  \nYours Sincerely,  \n*(first name)*\n\nThere are no attachments or links, and it just seems to be a plain text email. I checked my mail (including spam, promotions etc.) and it's all just your average automated emails from stuff like Google and Tumblr. Definitely nothing hand-written.\n\nI woke up this morning to another email, exact same title and body from the same address (first letter of the title uncapitalized), sent at 4:17am.\n\nSo... this doesn't seem *obviously* dangerous, it's just text, but the circumstances around it seem extremely suspicious. I might have replied to it if it was my main email, but I literally never use this one, and I figured if it was an actual human being they would at least mention what they're contacting for?\n\nMy best guess is that this is an automated thing sent to hundreds or thousands of random email addresses, and then once you reply they try to rope you into giving details or clicking things. But any second opinions before I report it would be appreciated :)",

However Stripe confirmed to me that they are using their own code for this element.\n\nThere is a \"bank\" listed under the name Lili, which you may recognize as the popular mobile banking app featuring a yellow and black logo. The form simply displays a field for your username and password, and then a link at the bottom \"continue to financial institution\" as well as \"Submit.\" \n\nFollowing the former will redirect you to the domain \"lilibank.com,\" which appears to be some sort of real estate company based out of Canada. However, there's little to no actual information on this site. And the few listings I attempted to verify were not even for sale. The site also has no real information on who controls it or how to contact them, lots of 404's etc.\n\nRegardless, whatever \"lilibank.com\" is, they certainly don't seem to have a need for  bank credentials to link to Stripes platform as an \"external account.\"\n\nStripe wouldn't tell me how long they had been allowing this phishing/misrepresentation campaign to go on but from what I was able to dig up it seems to have started sometime around January 2023.\n\nOr am I missing something here?\n\n\nLili's authentic domain is \"lili.co\", not \"lilibank.com\", and can usually be found via Plaid's tool, you just have to use the search function. I was asked by Stripe continuously to reach out to my bank to ensure I had the correct domain. And as of the time of this post the extremely misleading/fraudulent representation of Lili is still collecting creds.",

You are the billionth person to want to know what TAs hope to achieve with the emails they send. There's no answer that is going to satisfy you because you think you are being personally targeted instead of the possibility that your email is on a list and sending emails is all taken care of by bots who are sending out the emails to everyone they have an address for.\n\n> Can I get malware from clicking on it?\n\nIt's possible, but unlikely from just the email. Going to a website is more of a threat.",

The e-mail was legitimately from [PayPal.com](https://PayPal.com). I went to the website manually and checked my dashboard. It had the request. I clicked \"Cancel\" and it also said to call a phone number to report a fraudulent charge. This number is illegitimate and is 1-888-221-1161 (don't call).\n\nI called to report the charge. There was no annoying customer service robot (Red Flag 1). I explained the situation to the person. He then told me someone has access to my account. I explained that a charge hadn't happened, that someone had just requested money from me. I didn't get a straight answer (Red Flag 2). He then tried to get me to download some software that allows VPN remote access (Red Flag 3). I didn't download it or install it. He instead told me to go to a website: [phelp.online](https://phelp.online) \\- don't go to it. I stupidly did, but didn't enter any information, immediately closed it, and hung up on him.\n\nI found a different phone number on the PayPal website, called them, and reported it. What I stupidly hadn't realized is that the phone number I originally called was written as a note by the requester, not an official PayPal comment \\*facepalm\\*\n\nAnyway, I didn't give out any information, download anything, or anything like that. But I did go to that stupid phelp website very briefly. I'm on a Mac, all of my software is up to date. I immediately changed all important passwords just to be safe. Is there anything else I should do?",

        "selftext": "(I would post an image or the text of the suspect email, but when I reported it, it was removed from my inbox.)\n\nI sent a package today from a self-service kiosk at a local USPS office.  The receipt printer was down, so it requested an email address to which a receipt would be sent.  Shortly after my visit, I received an emailed receipt.\n\nSeveral hours later, I got another email, supposedly from the USPS.  It stated (paraphrasing), \"The mail you sent today cannot be delivered as addressed and will be sent to the return address.  This often occurs when the destination address is incorrect.  For additional information, click here.\"  And there was a button to be clicked.\n\nI damn near did it, too, as the email had been sent to the same address I used for the receipt and I had just mailed a package hours before.  I paused, however, and noted that the return address was something like, \"DoNotReply@infoevents.com\" and nothing related to USPS or \".gov.\"  I checked the tracking link within the valid receipt I got earlier and there appears to be nothing amiss.\n\nMy question is ... how did the phishers know?  Was this just a crazy coincidence?  Does the USPS have malware in their system which gave my address to the phishers?  Do they have some sort of \"passive scan\" on who gets email from the USPS so they can try to trick them?  (As for me, I ran full Windows Defender and Malware Bytes scans afterward and nothing was detected.)",

The only thing I can think of that would be malware related is a browser extension that sees your searches and know you planned on visiting the post office. But even those don\u2019t need to phish you. They already have access. \n\nTheoretically if you have an android phone, and installed some sort of malware that had access to your gps, someone could phish you. But again, why would I phish you if I already have access?\n\nCybersecurity has a \u201ckill chain\u201d methodology. First stage is recon, then initial access, then execution then persistence. And they go in that order. Phishing is initial access and malware is execution. So an attacker would not go backwards in the killchain. \n\nAlso, an attacker who has successfully breached the post office is not going to target citizens. They can literally move laterally to target businesses who have USPS accounts.",

If you have trouble memorizing them a password manager is a great tool for that.\n\nTo avoid falling for these type of phishing attempts in the future here is a collection of some great tools:\n\n[virustotal.com](https://virustotal.com) \\- you can submit the suspicious URLs/links you get in emails and text messages, and it will tell you if it has been reported as being related to phishing/ malicious activity.\n\n[https://talosintelligence.com/reputation\\_center/email\\_rep](https://talosintelligence.com/reputation_center/email_rep) \\- you can submit a suspicious email address here and get more information about the reputation of it  \n\n\n[https://unshorten.it/](https://unshorten.it/) \\- If you get a shortened URL, you can submit it here, and it will give you the full URL, which you can submit on reputation checking platforms (e.G. VirusTotal)  \n\n\nAnd generally speaking if you get any even just a little bit suspicious text or email make sure to look up the company's phishing advisory page, they tell you what to look for in their mails/texts to determine if it is legitimate or a phishing campaign impersonating them.",

I'm hoping this is all it is.\n\nI'm confident that my Coinbase account is secure, but is there a chance that my computer is compromised in some other way?\n\nAre there any additional security precautions I should take?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xkqqmtxlh2o91.png?width=2562&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac1bef0e99059f5ef9c4fb377f6ef5f3b1cf6b08",

However, I did today receive a message that claimed it had been found. Foolishly, i jumped the gun as a result of the excitement and proceeded to fill in my information (Apple ID) and password. I later realised that this was a phishing attack as Apple don't send texts. I then changed my password and checked the signed in devices. My question is now, what steps do I take or is it little too late? Should I delete my Icloud or not? I am kinda scared and feel lost as to what I should do.\n\nThank you",

It just sent me to reply to the email and I said \"I don't have an iphone 13\" or something along those lines. I know. It's a very obvious scam but I fell for it. I'm a bit tired as it's late and night and was doing something in my email for a scholarship thing but that's beside the point. So I replied to the email and got an email from that message blocker thing I forgot what it is but it's legit I know that's for sure. It said 9 emails couldn't receive the reply and when I looked at who I sent it to, there were like 27 ish emails that I sent that too :(. Most had . uk or . ru endings and this all happened on my iphone mail app. How likely is it that my iphone is hacked or my gmail is hacked? I didn't input any personal information but I'm definitely afraid. I changed my Apple ID password, Paypal password, and Gmail password so far. I don't want to set up two factor authentication up on my phone for things that don't have it yet for fear of my phone being compromised. I just finished updating my phone to the newest update. I plan on contacting Apple and hopefully Google tomorrow morning. What else should I do? How at risk am I? Am I already compromised?",

I suggest also checking your email address on HaveIBeenPwned, to see if it was a part of a data breach in the past, so you can figure out from where they obtained your email.",

So, if I am a customer of a phone company and I've heard that spammers/phishers are making it appear that I am, or my company, is calling them, can I have my phone company, set this up for my account? If so, any ideas what company(ies) have that technology?\n\nIs this forum, r/phishing, a good place to ask this question, or is there another forum that would be better? Thanks ...",

They persisted and I blocked them without giving anything. \nToday I noticed that I received an email yesterday stating someone tried to reset my Instagram password.

Of course I didn't call the number listed. I just deleted it and ran 3 different malware/antivirus software brands. Nothing came up as malware/virus. \n\nI think I'm in the clear, but was wondering if anyone can help me confirm that this email (that got past my Gmail spam folder) was only trying to get me to call the DB on the other end of the line and didn't contain malware. It was for something like 699.99 of Bitcoin. \n\nTagging this onto an older thread due to relevance to the topic.",

        "selftext": "I've been getting notifications of fake accounts following mine.  I've clicked on the links to each user's page every time, and I've noticed a pattern with the three accounts:\n\n1. The user claims to be a conventionally attractive young woman looking for sex.  Their bios often talk about how \"wet\" and thirsty they are, and they even use photos of young women posing provocatively, usually in revealing, tight-fitting clothing or just their underwear.\n2. None of these users have any posts or comments in their history.\n\nEven if these were real girls looking to hook up and get some action, I'm still not interested in them following me right off the bat the very second they've freshly created a Reddit account.  It just doesn't seem natural to me that someone would follow a complete stranger without first finding them on a certain subreddit, most likely one dedicated to hooking up, which I am not at all part of.\n\nI would feel bad if I had accidentally blocked a real person who thought I was a completely different user with a very similar username, but unless that person is either incredibly bad at communicating or giving out a fake username because he's a serial cheater, it's highly unlikely that this is the case, considering it's happened more than once.  I'm getting very annoyed at this point and just want this to stop.\n\nAlso, in case it has anything to do with it, I also got phished through my text messages a couple of times from two different phone numbers pretending to be the same thirsty redhead who claims to have gotten a wrong number from a guy she hooked up with.  Further details include racy selfies and even nude pics, oblivion to the meaning of the word \"no\" that would make you think this woman needs mental help if she's even a real person, and pertinent existence that I'm a guy with a \"huge cock,\" even after I told her several times that I'm a straight woman who is not interested.  Also, the second time around I started getting kind of rude because I was just getting tired of having my privacy breached by either a mentally unwell woman who refused to let go and consider how her actions were affecting both herself and others or either a catfish or phishing AI.  The three above incidents that have happened to me here on Reddit reminded me of this, which is why I'm mentioning it, as I think there's a possibility that they're connected.",

        "selftext": "So randomly, I get this email stating one of my \"Family Members\" was in a mobile crash and died. They said it was in Denmark so I search the details on Google and found nothing. (First Read Flag). Then I told him that I searched the details online and he completely ignored what I said. He says \n\n\"This is to inform you that,You have been named the beneficiary of the late Craig \\[Last Name\\], Account who was involved in an auto mobile crash on the 15th of march 2021 here in Copenhagen,Denmark. Until his death i was is account officer, hoping to receive a response from you about your interest soon\"\n\nSince he completely ignored what I said, I'm noting that as Flag Two.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen he send me a long detailed email which can be found in the comments(I'll link it to Imgur after I'm finished). After that, he then says, \" I sent you more details in response to your reply and I was wondering if you received it? I will also like to have your phone number so we can have a verbal conversation ok. Thanks. \" Beings that I know you can easily track a phone number, I never gave him my number. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe very first email he sent me was from his GMAIL. So now I'm thinking, \"If this is legit, why not send it to me from his work email?\" Then the rest of the emails were sent to me using Outlook, but he tried to make it seem like it was from Sydbnk(Which is his \"company\")(Red Flag Three). I also dig a little more and found a guys name, and his email (The actual guy he was impersonating). He had a legit looking email that at the end it said \\[@sydbnk\\]. I figured, why not text him and let him know that someone is impersonating him.",

I started to get scared and pulled the LAN cable from my pc.   \nAfter reattaching it my internet still didnt work, so i went downstairs where others also had problems with their internet connections. At that point i shut down the modem and restarted it. Afterwards everything was back to normal speed.  \n\n\nBut i want to ask what was that, i mean it could be pure coincidence but i dont believe that. Could it be like a DDOS to my modem? (IDK if thats posible) Or should i check all the connected devices for mallware? were they downloading our files? Do you guys have any ideas and what i can do to check it?  \n\n\nI did already:  \nRun a full virus scan  \nRebooted my pc in safe mode and checked the programs which are automaticly started in task manager  \nDeleted all my temp files  \nChecked task manager for strange new programs  \n\n\nAlready so much thanks for your help and time, i hope you guys can take my fears away...",

I read him some of the posts here that were similar, and the responses about why everything's fine, and he like \\*instantly\\* calmed down and brightened up. He's still changing all his passwords, which I mean, hell yeah, but he's an anxious person and it was really good to see him relax, and within an hour. \n\nSo, thanks, all!",

                "comment_text": "You will most likely be fine assuming you did not enter any of your personal information. I have examined huge numbers of phishing sites (and the code that powers them) and in general they're very basic and simply send any entered credentials to the fraudster via email.\n\nIn the case where a site is more sophisticated, most modern browsers operate using something known as a sandbox which prevents nefarious code running on a website from accessing other data on your device. While it is possible for vulnerabilities to exist within the browser sandbox, these are rare and are typically fixed very quickly by the maintainers of that browser. Trojans are often installed by a victim downloading a malicious file and running it on their device.\n\nMy general advice is to practice a basic level of online security, i.e. ensure you use a well-known and maintained browser, use different passwords for all your online accounts, and where available use two factor authentication on any website that supports it. If you're concerned about a compromise, for peace of mind you could reset your password for Citibank (assuming you use them)\n\nDepending on your location and/or provider you can forward malicious SMS to help prevent more of these scams in future. For example, in the UK you can forward the SMS to 7726 (T9 for SPAM) or in the US AT&T also offer a service on 7726.",

I use Vivaldi browser and have both Defender active and Eero Secure (not because it's awesome, but because it was almost free :)) To my recollection I have not slipped recently on links or attachments.  However I noticed a couple of days ago a few visual redirects to a \"prj12\" dot com that hiccuped but ultimately brought me to the right place.  Yesterday while going to Airbnb I got a Google red screen for the site.\n\nReview of history had URLs of that domain plus of one letter and 1-2 number subs like /e1 (for Ebay) /hd7 (for Home Depot) or /a3 (for ABB).  A few more for Vimeo, Walmart, and Hotels-dot-com.  First one was from May 2021.  Only other weirdness was some sort of Perl script callout named gohere dot pl with a Home Depot logo.\n\nDid a web search and found nothing.  Whois says domain is over a year old.  URL now resolves without incident.  Did a few different malware checks and found nothing.  Any idea what this crap is?",

I didn\u2019t think anything of it, because it came from a school email, and we had gotten similar emails in the past. But a couple days later, the IT department said that it was a phishing scam and they would text people and try and get information, like your school account login, and in some cases SSN and banking information. I got a text from them after I found out it was a scam, and I was wondering if there is anything I can do to get revenge now that I have what I believe to be this guys personal number.",

This individual has emailed me twice, through two separate email addresses. The second email from the other email address says the exact same thing as his first email. \n\nAs you can see, his World Health Organization link is not secure. I didn't click on it. \n\nThe medical license and whole licensed psychologist thing is true, though. I did find a Todd Adamson, licensed phychologist with the California Board of Psychology, operating in Los Angeles. They have a phone number and office listed on google maps too, with a picture of Mr. Adamson. \n\nI plan on emailing the real Todd Adamson about this matter. I assume he'd want to hear about it and might be able to sue if this scammer risks harming his reputation or otherwise using his name for illegitimate purposes.",

But it didn't even load, it said I didn't have internet connection (which I did have). I inmediately turned off wifi and data, and ran the antivirus a couple times, which didn't bring up anything. I also tested the link through several link checking pages, most saying the it's safe, with a few flagging it as dangerous or \"potential phishing\". Also, the link is from an Indonesian address (.id) (not my country).\n\nShould I be worried about my device's safety?

        "selftext": "My friend texted me this, and I immediately knew this was suspicious.\n\nI was bit curious to what it was, so I went on my VM to open the link using Microsoft Edge. It redirected me to an Instagram login page that looked pretty real. Not wanting to use my main Instagram credentials, I signed up using an alternate email address. It asked for a email verification, and I gave it. But I stopped the sign up when it asked for a phone number for an SMS verification. Unfortunately, that process didn't have a skip function, which by itself seemed weird to me.\n\nAfter this halt on my VM, my curiosity got the best of me, and I opened up the link on my main PC. However, it didn't redirect me to the login page. It was stuck loading. There was nothing downloaded, or asked for permission for anything. I'll change my main Instagram's password, just in case though.\n\nI'm still puzzled on what the link actually does. The website I was redirected to seemed official. The URL didn't contain anything weird. So I'm hoping someone can shed a light to this. Thanks for reading.\n\n[txt. from friend](https://preview.redd.it/lxtwxjm1drg71.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b46a7501f6fe267d73288412620880db462f6694)",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone, this is my first post on Reddit I hope I am doing this right. So I am currently seeking jobs on Indeed and my profile is set to private as well as my resume.  I then get a message on Indeed from a recruiter that has an opportunity by the name of Alfredo Gruspe from Thorkelson Ltd, looking to fill a chat specialist position in that company (I get these messages all the time.)\n\nSo I agree for my email to be shared. A day or 2 later I receive an email from another person from the company an HR Manager by the name of Loretta Shaffer saying how she looked at my profile on indeed and says there's an opening for an Online Service Manager she'd like to tell me more.\n\n2 minor red flags I did not pay heed to in the email when greeting me she referenced my email, and she's emailing about another job. Anyways she explained the position and another thing I didn't pay attention too the duties were somewhat vague and didn't make sense. I googled the company they had a website looked kind of legit didn't really pay much heed because they did not ask for any sensitive information or anything so continued she said if I am interested\n\nI need to make an application on the website which I did this is where I kind of slipped the ball I inputted my name, address, and phone number, and age. But all of this is on my resume so did not think much except the age. Anyways the biggest red flag was the when I got the offer letter it did not make sense that a company would offer a position without a phone interview or video so I ended all communication with them and will be reporting to the fraud authorities in Canada. Hopefully they are not able to do much with the info I gave them but I will be monitoring my Transunion and equifax monthly to be certain.\n\nMoral of the story if it is too good to be true it probably is fake.\n\nI was very naive and I will be more vigilant next time. I hope this helps someone.",

I have seen many of these fake links where it displays a fake roblox page, all stolen from the ui, and there is typically a control center linked to that website. I have encountered one myself, and you can register, make your own fake links with a fake username, and using an avatar that isn\u2019t even linked to that username. Unfortunately, it will redirect you to a log in page as the scammers could never replicate the delicate and very difficult to access code within Roblox\u2019s API. And everything sent to the fake site, it would typically save in a database, then it would send to you. One i had come across surprisingly had a leaderboard with the people who had phished the most people. Fortunately, there are ways to not get tricked. PAY ATTENTION! Pay attention to the link, and consider if you are already logged in. If the link looks too real but you\u2019re not logged in, it is possible that you are already logged in and the site can not replicate that. Anyways, this is possible by 1:\nStealing the login page ui \n2:\nStealing the user viewing page ui\n3: \ninput a bunch of loggers into the login page\n4: \nwhen data input, then send to database\n5:\nwhen sent to database, then send data to user who made link\n\nKeep in mind, as technology strengthens, these methods might keep getting harder and harder to detect. It is also possible that it may grab your cookie, but that is rare and highly sophisticated, too complex for public roblox phishing sites.\n\nThese sites are usually copy and pasted around the web as they get easily found and deleted, because it violates most of the web hosters terms and service. This is also not safe to use for the possibility of you getting ip logged, or karma coming back to kick you in the \ud83c\udf51\n\nAnyways, that\u2019s all about these malicious links and sites. As said, double check roblox login links as if there is one letter that\u2019s off, you should let it go. I hope I didn\u2019t bore you too much, goodbye!",

For example, an email might inform a customer that Canada Post tried to deliver a package and asks the customer to select a link or visit a Post Office to arrange delivery.

        "selftext": "Hi.\nSo I received an email that seemed to be from Amazon that said\n\n \"We have locked your Amazon account and all pending orders. We have taken this action because the billing information you provided does not match the information on file with the card issuer. To resolve this issue, please verify now with the billing name, address, and phone number stored on your credit card. if you have recently moved, you may need to update this information with the card issuer.  If we cannot complete the verification process within 3 days, all pending orders will be canceled. You will not be able to access your account until this process is complete. We ask that you do not open new accounts as any new order you place may be delayed. We appreciate your patience with our security measures. Thank you for your attention. Best regards,\nAmazon Service Team\" \n\nThe email included a link that said \"Check Now\". Now, my Amazon account has been locked for the last six months with no explanation and I've been calling their customer service non-stop.  There had been no response and I thought the phishing email was the response I had been waiting for.  So, being the moron that I am, I clicked it on my laptop because I saw that the email was from \"no-reply@amazon.com\" which was really just the display name and the address was a sketchy ass email.  I was greeted by the Google Chrome \"Dangerous Website\" warning and my fucking stomach dropped.  I immediately clicked out of the link (no forms filled out at all) and cleared my browser history. I have McAfee Total Protection installed as well as the standard Windows antivirus.  Usually McAfee will scan any downloads made automatically, and I'll receive a pop-up letting me know that it's been scanned.  No pop-up was shown, and I didn't see any downloads in my File Explorer.  I disconnected from my wifi and did a Quick Scan with McAfee, which detected no virus.  I am currently running a full scan, but I'm awaiting results.  \n\nAs you can probably tell I'm pretty stupid with computers, but I know nothing about malware/viruses/ransomware/spyware except they scare the shit out of me.  I'm not too worried about any accounts of mine getting breached since I didn't fill out any forms (I'm certainly going to change sensitive passwords anyways).  But I'm worried about any hidden malware that can be on my computer now.  What is the likelihood that this link click has resulted in the hidden download of malware? Is there any major steps I'm missing that I should take for harm reduction? And also, when can i be pretty sure that my computer is safe and my accounts are safe? I don't want to be blindsided by this like half a year from now.\nI really hope I'm overreacting right now but I have absolutely no idea what to think, my mind is racing at a million miles an hour right now.  Thank you, and apologies for the wall of text\n\nEDIT: The scan finished with no threats found. My browser did get a \"long running script\" dialog box however, not sure if that means anything.",

The result is the same. \n\nI come away a hero once we recommend and deploy Avanan. End users actually start to notice a difference in the first couple of weeks and ask what's changed. The noise of spam and phishing and false positives are gone. \n\n\\[BTW: Those links are a little out of date. No one is going after your CEO anymore. They are going after naive contractors and office workers. Avanan figures this out on its own.\\]",

The saved password was acutally incorrect so I logged in with the right one, now i feel i've somehow been compromised but I don't understand the method.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe link doesn't work on desktop at all, it's 403 forbidden from non mobile.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've just never come across a phishing site that redirects to the real site before and i'm pretty befuddled.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone, I had some struggles with logging into PayPal and they said I had to change my password due to safety reasons. I didn't receive an e-mail to restore my account and change my password though. A few hours later I received an e-mail from \"PayPal\" saying my account was locked and that I had to restore it now. Might sound cliche, but normally I would check twice and usually don't fall for phishing. Also, there is a filter tool in my mail too, so it sends suspicious mail to my spam mails. I figured, since I had trouble with PayPal, this mail doesn't seem too weird to me. (I know, I'm so stupid!) I clicked the button and when Safari opened and the link was loading, I just closed it, because it seemed a little sus to me. Then I looked at the sender and it was like [mitch@americanstandardmoving.com](mailto:mitch@americanstandardmoving.com) and I also checked the link in the button (on my laptop) and it was to [https://wiabiliza.com.br/wp-admin/web](https://wiabiliza.com.br/wp-admin/web). Which was weird, since it was supposed to come from PayPal. That's when I realized it's phishing. Btw, I opened it via my iPhone. My question now is... Does anyone know if I will get hacked or if malware will be on my phone? I cleared cache & data from Safari and I even set my phone to factory settings. Thanks in advance!",

I\u2019d probably change my PayPal password unless i have Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled in which case I would leave it. \n\niOS is the safest place to open an email as typical they are the most secure. This is due to the closed ecosystem that Apple operate. That being said, if there is some huge undisclosed vulnerability in iOS then you, me and many other people are screwed. You\u2019re fine. \n\nAll the phisherpeople got was a report that you opened the email and clicked a link, of tracking was working correctly. If that is the case, prepare yourself to receive more phishing emails for a while. They now think you\u2019re susceptible so may try a few variations. \n\nSo to sum up - more than likely safe, could change your password if you fancy it, probably will get more emails.",

Then this morning I just received an e-mail from \"no_reply@email.apple.com\" referring to me by a different name and saying that a purchase was made on my AppleID account. The email itself never asked for anything but did link to the official apple page to update my info in case it wasn't me. \n\nI can't remember the order of events, but I followed the link which went to the AppleID update page and also checked the app store on my computer. The AppleID page had all my existing info, but said I was in Mainland China, and the App Store told me I had to be moved to the mainland China store, so some changes were definitely made to my account at some point (worth noting that original email ended up coming from appleid@id.apple.com, which is supposedly legit). My password hadn't been changed, nor had my security questions. I can't see any charges on my card at the moment, nor can I find any new apps on my macbook app store. There were no additional machines on my trusted devices. No receipts either. I changed my password at that link. Then I got paranoid about what damage may have been done by this point and started to think that I may have made a mistake by even following the link in the first place and independently went to the appleID page and changed my password again. \n\nTo be honest I'm kind of confused, worried, and don't even know what the next steps are. My AppleID was clearly compromised at some point, I may have made things worse by following the email link. Is there any guidance here?",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI had a friend approach me on FB messenger asking if I could help them retrieve their code as their phone was messing up. I said yes, gave them my mobile number and the codes that they sent to me (For gmail too).\n\nThey signed me out of my accounts and I started to suspect they were hacking me so I confronted them and they replied saying that they think they know what's going on and to give them 1 sec to fix it. I immediately got logged back onto FB and Google and they somehow earned back my trust. At this point I still think the hacker is my friend.\nThey go onto saying that they're still trying to figure it out on their account and to DL Skype so we can talk if it boots me out again. \n\nIt's getting late and I have to go to bed so I tell them to sort it out and msg me in the morning if it works. They're adamant that we get it sorted out quickly now, as they have a \"super busy day tomorrow\". So i go onto Skype and they add me, I get booted again and they call me but there's no voice or cam. So they hang up and tell me to call, but this time it's just my voice and my camera on. I kept most of my face out of the camera as I didn't really know why I needed it on... \n\nI asked what was taking so long for them to connect to the call, and they said its probably a reception problem.\nThey continue on to say \"why don't you read this while we wait\" and they copy and pasted a threat and a nude photo I took years ago. I didn't get to read all of the threat, when I called out for my partner the hacker deleted the threats and messages cursing me out for telling my bf. I responded saying I didn't care, and that I was going to bed. And they switched from a malicious tone to a relaxed tone saying \"it's just a joke\" \"Night haha\" \n\nI have reported it to cyber security here and have factory reset my phone. \nI'm concerned with what they can do with the information they have received. I can't delete or reset any accounts as they have my mobile number and they've already reset everything i can think of. \n\n\nTLDR; \nI was blind-sighted and gave out verification codes and my mobile number to someone who I thought was my friend. Locked out of FB and Gmail. Got blackmailed on Skype and cannot reset any passwords. Please help :/",

Block any sort of contact that you have with the hacker and do not give them any more information.\n\n\n2. IMMEDIATELY try to recover your Google account and change the password. You can get to your security settings from your [Google Account Page.](https://account.google.com) This is your key to regaining ownership of your accounts, without it you won't be able to do anything. Check your account to make sure no new third-party applications have access. Also check your primary and recovery email/phone number listed on your Google account in the security settings and make sure the information is correct.\n\n\n3. Once you've recovered your Google account sign out of all of your other devices (which will include the hacker). You can do this by going to your Gmail and in the bottom right corner click \"Details\" and then \"sign out of all other web sessions\". This should boot the hacker out and disable any active web sessions that they have logged into your account. Once your Google account is secure you can use your email to start recovering other accounts.\n\n\n4. Change your password for all major accounts and services. This includes bank accounts, file services like Dropbox, your phone carrier, Facebook, Skype, and anything else that was compramised. Do this for other important accounts that may not have been compromised. Ensure that your phone number and email address are listed as the main and recovery information for all of these accounts in case the hacker has changed that information to regain access at a later date. DO NOT USE THE SAME PASSWORD FOR ANY TWO ACCOUNTS.\n\n\n5. Enable two factor authentication for any important accounts that you have. This is probably automatically enabled for accounts like Facebook and your bank, but may not be enabled for less \"important\" accounts.\n\n6. If you're using an iPhone, ensure that you can access your iCloud account and change the password from your phone or computer at [iCloud.com](https://icloud.com). Ensure the recovery email address and phone number on the account are correct.\n\n\nOnce you've completed these steps you should be fairly safe. However since your Facebook account was hacked they probably sent out the same message that you fell for to your friends. Message your friends and/or post a status telling them to ignore any links, photos, or information that may have been accidentally sent to them so that they don't fall for the same thing.",

        "selftext": "I was sent a scam message from my \"mobile phone service provider\", which I interpreted as true and proceeded to enter the link provided in it.\n\nThis brought me to a login page for the service, after which I went ahead and entered my email and password to login.\n\nAs soon as I finished typing my password into the appropriate field, a message from Google appeared, stating something along the lines of \"Your password has been compromised\" and that I needed to change it for all the services I used it with. I quickly closed the message and deleted the credentials I typed out.\n\nThroughout all of this, I was logged into my own Google account, which makes me believe that at least the Google message that appeared on the fake login screen was actually legitimate.\n\nBecause of this, I want to ask: can fake login pages such as the one I entered my details in see what you typed in the fields they provide even though you haven't pressed \"Enter\" (and thus sent a request to the website, which, in that case, would be obviously visible to the scammers)? Should I change the passwords for any service I use this particular one with? Is it even necessary for me to worry at all?",

They offered $20/hr for an \"assistant\" job on Indeed and emailed me with an offer. Without an interview or so much as a phone call, I get an employment contract (Which I hope they can't do anything with because I signed it like a fool).\n\nThey then quickly set up a meeting on telegram (I posted the conversation). Before the meeting I got a call from them which seemed genuine, basically just generic questions and going over my resume. Then I'm told to wait until they're ready to conduct the telegram meeting where they break into a whole tirade about Ethereum. The idea is that they want me to set up an account so I can preform my duties, which I guess are simply making domain purchases with company money for their clients.\n\nThey wanted my ID with a picture of myself self, which sounds like identity theft in the making. Normally you should fill out information like this on a proper application form. When I asked for one they said they'd look, when I asked where they were located, they went silent. Their plan probably involves asking for more info if you indulge them. The ethereum account may eventually require some activation, who knows, I didn't get that far. But they'd probably try to link it to your person and either bleed you or commit fraud under your name.\n\nAccording to their website they operate from the Guinness Business Center in Vancouver (which is conveniently a rental space). I attached the face of the woman conducting the orientation in case someone tries to find out about this company using a reverse image search (I couldn't find her though). And a search for kannis group is much more likely to yield results for a 2 employee company in bolivia than this vancouver based one. I deleted telegram and left, pretty sure a real company would call again to ask what happened to me, but they've moved on.\n\nI hope this helps someone, and stay safe out there.",

I've been stressing over trying to find a new job during a pandemic so my guard was off. Basically, I almost fully went through with a dumb PayPal scam. The email seemed legit and stated that there was suspicious activity and I had to change my information. Unfortunately, I've already entered my SNN, my mothers maiden name, and card info. It wasn't until I realized the website didn't have the word \"secured\" in the URL that it was a total scam and I quickly pressed the back button and closed the window. I'm very well aware that once I put in that information and press \"next\" they most likely already have that information encrypted somewhere and can still use it against me even though I never fully submitted the scam.\n\nFirst thing I did was change my PayPal password, email password, turn off all my cards and change my bank login. I also made a Equifax account and I'm trying to initiate a security freeze but the site keeps saying \"we can't complete this request right now\". Its currently late at night as I'm typing this plea so I'm trying to do the most that I can until the morning.\n\nIs there anything else I should do? Please no rude comments, I'm already beating myself up over this. Again, I'm usually hyperaware about this kind of stuff but this moment totally slipped my mind and I was doomed as soon as I realized my mistake.",

        "selftext": "So I received an email on my phone telling me that my PayPal account was locked. I ignored it, stating in my head that I would deal with it later. However, when I opened up the email on my PC, something just felt off for me. So I did what any sensible person would do and instead of clicking on the link to \"verify my identity\" I went to PayPal itself and tried to log in. And what do you know, I can log in just fine with no problems.\n\nSo long story short it's obviously a scam, but this isn't what the post is about. After I reported the email to Paypal I wanted to dig a little deeper into this since I don't usually get that many phishing attempts sent to my email. When I first looked at the email from my phone, I noticed the email was addressed as [service@PayPal.com](mailto:service@PayPal.com) , which seemed legit until I opened it on my pc and realized that that was just the account's name, and the actual log in ID was a bunch of random letters and numbers @ what I can only assume to be a free mail hosting service. Kinda scary how most phones only show the email's name since as I can see how a lot of people might be tricked by that, but that's besides the point. I inspected the button they sent in that email and found it linking to what is clearly not PayPal, but I wasn't brave enough to actually see where it went. However, when I went to view the raw message, a feature I was only slightly aware of in Yahoo Mail, I was able to go through it and pretend I understood exactly what everything meant. For fun, I decided to view the raw message of an actual PayPal email to compare, and this is where I found this.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8hwip250u1t51.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb143a7fd904a2415e4346bf090e5d47a5d89fa6\n\nI can only imagine PayPal put this in here in case something went wrong with the email and the actual HTML message couldn't be sent? I checked with the email and this isn't what it contained. The bit about privacy at the end was present on both ends so it clearly was meant to be viewed in one context or another. I just like the idea of stumbling onto some brand's failsafe by accident, while also bringing forth some unneeded awareness about these emails.\n\nDoes anyone know the exact context this would be needed, or am I looking too much into this?",

We also expedited takedowns of the phishing URLs involved.  This of course was like a whack-a-mole game as new phishing URLs are so easy to stand up.  The volume of the reports was also a good indicator of how our response went.  If there were a trickle of reports, then we could figure that users were not being targeted very accurately.  If there was a larger volume, we could go into a higher alert mode because our users were being accurately targeted.",

I also check my email regularly (I always have it open on my PC when I work) and I would have noticed a back and forth of emails on that day. \n\nWhat do you think happened?

Im just a little scared that it might of some how been a fake website and app (because it is a very outdated way to change a password and i have not been in that site for a long time and it looks diffrent) and just wanted to ask overall.\nThere is no way this is a phising link from a fake site right?",

A general safe practice is to never use links in emails but since you had to so that your account could be recovered there are a few things you can do to ensure your account is safe. \n\nGo into the app or the website (without using the link in the emails) and change your password again. Ensure that you choose a password that you have never used before and don't use that password on different accounts.\n\nAgain overall I think it is unlikely that you were phished but these are still good precautions.

Change the password to that email account, if you don\u2019t already have it enable 2fa. Talk tour your gf about old email accounts. And do the same for them.\n\nThe link you shared I haven\u2019t analysed yet, I\u2019m not at a laptop. But can I suggest you edit your post and change the . In it to [.] so that the link is not a hyperlink. If you believe that url to be malicious it would be best to break the hyperlink so that people don\u2019t accidentally click on it and get directed to that potentially malicious domain.",

I got as far as clicking a second link to unsubscribe from all emails before realizing it was associated with \"http: //nipinthebutorweareinshocks. actzumba. com /\", clearly not legit, and closing it.\n\nI went back and took a closer look at the email and the entire thing is one large image which I assume directs to that fake unsubscribe page.  I copied the link and put it into virus total and it came up OK.\n\nI ran Google Play protect and nothing unusual came up.  I didn't enter any passwords or other sensitive information, but that's actually the thing that confuses me - I don't understand what the \"scam\" could be here other than like, installing malware or something since it appears to all link to that one page with no sensitive data requested.\n\nAny ideas what that's all about, and what I should do about it?

Regardless if the company is legitimate, could this be enough to put me in trouble?**  \n\n\nI received an email from \"TriggerVPN\", with my email address but someone else's name, saying I've registered for a free trial with automatic renewal.\n\nI figured it was a user-error, using my email address by mistake. But, digging into it a bit and due to some actions I took, I'm a bit worried.\n\nHovering over the links, they seem to be using HubSpot, which seems legitimate. However, when Googling TriggerVPN, the only thing I can find is their website. Googling their phone number returns nearly nothing but some Chinese websites.   \n\n\nI made the mistake of calling them with my phone number instead of using a burner VOIP number. When I called and asked for assistance with the virtual assistant, they asked for my credit card to find my account. When I refused to give it, I was put on the line with a representative. She was unable to give me the company name (TriggerVPN), as they're a call centre that works with multiple companies. She asked for my name and email, which I gave. She found my account and said there was a credit card number ending in 4 digits that I didn't recognize. Once I told her that's not me, she said  she'll remove me from future communications and abruptly hung up.   \n\n\nMy worry is that they have my email, phone number, and name tied together, which I'm not sure if it's enough to commit identity fraud. The alarming part is obviously that an automated message asks for my credit card, but if this is a phishing attack, it's one of the most sophisticated one I've seen. I can't tell if it's an incredibly tiny, unknown, piss-poor company or if it's malicious. I called my provider and put on port-out protection, which can only be removed with some very specific info from me.",
